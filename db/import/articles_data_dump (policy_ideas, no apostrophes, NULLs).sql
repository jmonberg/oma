However, high-density should not be cause for worry unless the residents of these areas are restless or discontent with their surroundings.  The residents of high-density areas along the Michigan Avenue Corridor need to be able to enjoy a variety of activities and services that will leave them feeling anything but restless. Taken into account the vast range of household budgets, the following proposed activities offer a plentitude of options for youth and families. The proposed ideas for activity spaces are separated into three categories: a Healthy Lifestyles Gymnasium; an Arts, Music, and Games Center; and a Pro-Earth and Outdoor Recreation Station.\r\n\r\nThe Healthy Lifestyles Gymnasium is a top priority in catering to youth and families in high-residential areas. An important aspect to high-density communities is the availability of resources which incorporate worthwhile activities that are still fun for kids. Health and education are two subjects that should not be abandoned outside of school walls. While building a gymnasium will cost a community an upwards of $200 per square foot, promoting health in today’s youth is now a necessary investment. The activities that the Healthy Lifestyles Gymnasium will  provide include, but are not limited to: various sports teams; cardio and strength-training fun; healthy eating sessions; and seminars and classes that deal with healthy lifestyles and choices. The Gymnasium will cover an area of approximately 15,000 square feet. Membership fees will cater to family income.\r\n\r\nThe Arts, Music, and Games (AMG) Center will provide surrounding youth with a chance to express themselves creatively and have loads of fun. Annual fees for the AMG Center will depend on a family’s income, as well. With admission to the Center, art, dance, theater, and music lessons are free (however, a child may enroll in only one lesson at a time). An arcade will also reside within the Center, where children and teens will have their choices at various games and fun activities. Admission into the arcade will require $5 per person every time. The AMG Center will be approximately 10,000 square feet and cost between $80 and $175 per square foot. Finally, the Pro-Earth and Outdoor Recreation Station (PEORS) will allow youth to get involved in cleaning up their communities and enjoying nature. The actual Station will be small, only 625 square feet or so, and will house information regarding Community Clean-up, Rent-a-Garden spaces, and Adopt-an-Animal services. The building will be surrounded by trails for walking, rollerblading, and biking. In the winter, the trails will be groomed for cross-country skiing and, in some areas, snowmobiling. \r\n\r\nFor more information regarding youth and healthy lifestyles, please visit \"Healthy Lifestyles\":http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3003754.

The fact is, many of the surrounding residents are not young; senior citizens make up a good portion of Mid-Michigan and the Lansing area, which is why they, too, fall into the category of High Density Development. Many of the younger generation are left scratching their heads over ways to benefit seniors in the development of the Michigan Avenue Corridor.  Fortunately, plans for senior citizens are underway.\r\n\r\nAn assisted-living home will be provided in or near residential complexes for senior citizens. The proximity of this home will allow spouses and friends to have easy and convenient visitation. The assisted-living home will benefit those who are struggling with mental and/or physical disabilities, while also catering to the needs of the surrounding families. The assisted-living home will not provide patient rehab. A separate Rehab and Nursing Center will also reside in or near the assisted-living and residential complexes for senior citizens. This rehab center will benefit seniors who live either at the assisted home or independently. The rehab center will employ physical therapists, occupational therapists, and nurses. Again, the proximity of the rehab facility will help with the transportation of patients and those there to show support. The assisted living home and rehab center will cover areas of approximately 12,000 and 24,000 square feet, respectively. The cost of these medical facilities is approximately $250 per square foot.\r\n     \r\nFinally, a Senior Entertainment Center will be erected for the entertainment of surrounding senior citizens. Ideally, this Senior Center would also reside near residential complexes and assisted-living homes. The Senior Center will provide a variety of activities for visiting senior citizens, including senior-oriented exercise programs, film and television show screenings, arts and crafts, sewing and quilting, cooking and baking lessons, and more. The Senior Center will also cater to the elderly who cannot or do not wish to leave their homes. The Center will deliver meals weekly for only a small charge. As a borrowing service, books and movies may also be delivered for free. The Senior Entertainment Center will cover approximately 5,000 square feet. The cost for this public facility will be between $80 and $200 per square foot. \r\n\r\nFor more information regarding Assisted Living Homes and Senior Rehab Centers, see \"Assisted Living\":http://www.assistedlivinginfo.com/ and \"Senior Rehab Facility\":http://www.parentgiving.com/articles/senior_rehab_and_the_healing_process/.\r\n','http://www.cgschmidt.com/images/category/senior.jpg','http://www.emoryhealthcare.org/Images/ww_images/senior-rehab.jpg','© CG Schmidt 2009','Emory Healthcare 2008.

An assisted home is not an alternative to a nursing home, but an intermediate level of long-term care. The Assisted Living Home will create a service plan for each individual resident upon admission. The service plan details the personalized services required by the resident and guaranteed by the facility. The plan is updated regularly to assure that the resident receives the appropriate care as his or her condition changes. \r\n     \r\nCaretakers and nurses will be available on staff 24/7. Visitors are welcome from 8 am to 8 pm everyday, and may stay overnight if proper sign-in procedures take place. Three meals a day will be provided: Breakfast, a large lunch, and a smaller dinner.

The Assisted Living Home will cover an area of approximately 12,000 square feet. Cost per square foot of a public medical facility is approximately $250. Handicap accessibility is necessary. For residents, the average cost for an assisted living facility will fall between $60 and $70 per day. The cost will cover room, board, and meals. Some long-term insurance plans cover assisted living.\r\n\r\nFeatures of the Senior Assisted Living Home will include, but are not limited to: Beautifully decorated and spacious private and semi-private rooms; numerous recreational activities specific to each level of care; delicious meals and alternate menus planned to meet individual preferences and dietary restrictions; pleasantly landscaped yards and an enclosed courtyard garden; ample parking; excellent staff to resident ratio; air-conditioned comfort; cheerful and roomy Therapy Room; spacious lounge with television, pool table, couches and chairs; therapeutic recreation, activities, and outings; beauty/barber shop services; personal in-house laundry services; chaplain on staff with in-house services; and holiday celebrations featuring entertainment and delicious food.\r\n\r\nTo see an example of a beneficial Assisted Living Home, please visit http://www.caresolutionshome.com/\r\n\r\nFor more information and examples regarding assisted living homes, please visit the following links:\r\nhttp://www.assistedlivinginfo.com/\r\nhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/assistedliving.html\r\nhttp://www.assistedlivingonline.com/\r\nhttp://www.ncal.org/\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-21 20:27:56','2009-05-07 04:21:42',48,0,NULL,NULL),(18,'Dense Mixed Use','Senior Rehab Center','Lori Bates','The Senior Rehab and Nursing Center will be extremely beneficial to senior citizens who are in need of physical or mental therapy because of illnesses or accidents.

If a family’s annual income is less than $30,000 per year, then a mere $20 per month will cover them. If a family makes $30,000 to $50,000 per year, then they will pay $30 per month. If a family makes $50,000 to $70,000 per year, then they will pay $40 per month. Earning over $70,000 per year means a family will have to pay $50 per month.

A convenient location for PEORS would rest somewhere between Lansing and East Lansing. The actual station will be small, around 625 feet. Building details include wood construction, wood drywall, vinyl siding, and handicap accessibility. Public building costs are approximately $80 to $150 per square foot. The Station will serve as an information center for surrounding trails, community clean-up, and services like Rent-a-Garden and Adopt-an-Animal. One or two management clerks will need to be on site from 9-5 Monday through Friday.\r\n\r\nPEORS will ideally sit at the center of the trails and rail trails. These trails will run alongside the Michigan Avenue Corridor, spanning the length of East Lansing and into Lansing. In the spring, summer, and fall, trails will be used for walking, biking, running, and rollerblading. In the winter, trails will be groomed for cross-country skiing. In wider spaces, snowmobiling may be a possibility. Trails will need to be kept up weekly, and wooden bridges will need to be built over streams and rivers. For urban trail systems, an annual per-mile cost might run from $2500 to $10,000. For more information about trail costs, see www.americantrails.org/resources/. The trail will start somewhere around Abbott and Grand River in East Lansing, and will end near Riverfront Park in Lansing. Every Saturday, youth and parent supervisors will gather at the Station for community clean-up. Kids will take on a proactive role in cleaning up their community and helping the environment by picking up trash along the trails. Incentives for kids may be an afterward treat of ice cream or home-baked goods.\r\n\r\nThe other two services that will be provided by PEORS are Rent-a-Garden and Adopt-an-Animal. Lawns surrounding the Station will hold squares and rectangles of tilled earth. For a price of $1-3 per square foot, surrounding residents who live in apartments or who do not have space or resources for gardening can literally rent a garden space. Garden spaces hold for one year, and current renters may always renew their contracts. Garden users will have to provide their own seeds and plants for their spaces of earth. The Station will contract with surrounding animal shelters for the Adopt-an-Animal service. For people who cannot or do not wish to actually own a pet, this service will allow residents to set up an animal ‘adoption’ through the Station. Once they have ‘adopted’ their pet, they can visit the appropriate animal shelter as much as they’d like, providing care and attention for their adopted ‘pet.’ Contracts for adopting a pet will hold for three months at a time. Contracts will start at $30 per animal. If the animal is actually adopted before the three months is over, then the ‘adoptive’ family will be reimbursed for the time left in the contract. With these two services, children and families who cannot actually own gardens or pets will be able to enjoy either for a small cost.\r\n\r\n     \r\nTo read an article about a town’s decision to make a rail trail, visit http://www.brucefreemanrailtrail.org/news/20060622-SudburyTownCrier_towndiscussestrail.html\r\n     \r\nFor more information and examples involving the Lansing area and beyond, please visit the following links:\r\nPro earth \r\nhttp://kidsforsavingearth.org/index.html\r\nhttp://ecochildsplay.com/2008/01/07/you-can-save-the-planet-eco-tips-for-children/\r\nhttp://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/06/kids_want_to_save_planet.php\r\nhttp://planetsave.com/\r\nhttp://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/04/25_ways_to_save.php\r\nhttp://www.savetheplanet.org/\r\nOutdoor recreation\r\n http://www.discoverourtown.com/MI/Lansing/Recreation-3552.html\r\nhttp://www.outdoorcentral.com/state-parks/sleepy-hollow-state-park-partners-with-the-lansing-parks-and-recreation-department-to-offer-outdoor-recreation-experiences\r\nhttp://www.funoutdoors.com/\r\nhttp://www.michigan.org/Things-to-Do/Outdoors/Hiking/Default.aspx?city=G3233\r\nhttp://www.trailsource.com/scripts/trails.asp?CITY=Lansing&STATE=Michigan&TYPE=HIKE&CITYID=210\r\nhttp://ingham.org/ppz/index.htm\r\nhttp://www.bikely.com/listpaths/country/254/region/144/city/9055\r\nhttp://www.woldumar.org/\r\nAnimal Shelters\r\nhttp://www.magicyellow.com/category/Animal_Shelters/Lansing_MI.html\r\n\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-21 20:33:49','2009-05-07 04:21:42',48,0,NULL,NULL),(26,'Streetscape','Lighting for Michigan Avenue','Ryan Norris','<table class=\"image styled\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5em\" \r\ncellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n<caption align=\"bottom\">At night, the Earth is aglow with lights.<br><small>Credit: <a href=\"http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/\">NASA Visible Earth Project, EOS</a></small><br><br></caption>\r\n<tr><td><a href=\"http://veimages.gsfc.nasa.gov//1438/earth_lights.jpg\"><img title=\"Earth at Night From Space\" src=\"http://veimages.gsfc.nasa.gov//1438/earth_lights.jpg\" alt=\"Major cities at night are visible from space because of the light they emit\" align=\"right\"width=\"260\" HEIGHT=\"130\"/></a></td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<big><big><big><big>S</big></big></big></big>treet and path lighting play an important role in the usability of an urban space. Properly implemented, lighting can increase nighttime use of an area, improve public perception of a location’s safety, and contribute to urban beautification. Implemented carelessly, lighting can decrease safety, intrude into residents’ homes, impact wildlife, waste resources, and wash out the night sky. Along Michigan Ave., street lights guide motorists and pedestrians toward and away from the Capitol. By using Light Emitting Diodes (LED) for lighting along Michigan Ave., the Lansing area can follow other cities like Ann Arbor in utilizing greener technology while also improving the visual appeal of Michigan Ave at night.\r\n<big></big>\r\nLighting is a major cost to cities. For example, a city like an Ann Arbor can devote up to 25 percent of its energy budget to traffic lighting .  As a result, cities strive to combine efficiency with usability in their lighting plans. Until recently many cities turned to High Powered Sodium (HPS) and Metal Halide (MH) lamps to illuminate their streets and paths. These lighting sources provided benefits over older sources, including good cost and efficiency. Recently, LEDs have become an economically feasible alternative. LEDs have improved color rendition, last five times longer than other light sources, have a 50 percent energy savings, and utilize directed lighting. This means that street lights with LEDs can save a city money, reduce energy consumption, improve visual conditions in lit areas, and reduce light pollution.\r\n<big></big> \r\nLED lighting projects are already well underway throughout the country and in Michigan. In 2008, the Lansing Board of Water and Light (LBWL) worked with Michigan based company Midwest Circuits to develop and test LED light fixtures for the city. After an initial trial, LBWL decided to expand the trial to 100 lights. More detailed information about this project can be found from a **\"promotional pamphlet\":http://www.philipslumileds.com/pdfs/CS11.pdf** put out by Phillips Lumileds, the LED supplier for the project (PDF). Around the same time, the city of Ann Arbor, using a $630,000 grant from the Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority began an even more **\"ambitious program\":http://www.a2gov.org/government/publicservices/systems_planning/energy/Documents/LED_Summary.pdf.**  After initial testing, the city decided to retrofit 1,000 lamps with LEDs. The replacements are expected to save Ann Arbor $100,000 per year and reduce the city’s CO2 emissions by 260 tons. \r\n\r\n<h2>Subtopics</h2>\r\n\r\n**\"-Light Pollution\":http://churchsons.myvnc.com/articles/27**\r\n\r\n**\"-LEDs\":http://churchsons.myvnc.com/articles/104**\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-24 23:05:25','2009-04-30 22:57:25',13,2,NULL,NULL),(27,'Streetscape','Light Pollution: Not Just an Astronomers Problem','Ryan Norris ','<table class=\"image styled\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5em\"\r\ncellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n<caption align=\"bottom\">Light pollution fills the sky in a Canary Islands city<br><small> Credit: <a href=\" http://www.flickr.com/photos/cestomano/\">Flickr User:Cestomano</a></small></caption>\r\n<tr><td><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/cestomano/2222529405/\"><img title=\"Light Pollution by Flickr User Cestomano\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2418/2222529405_89d9dcb2a2_o.jpg\" alt=\"Lights create a glow above this city in the Canary Islands\" align=\"right\" width=\"200\"/></a></td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<big><big><big><big><big>L</big></big></big></big></big>ight pollution is contamination of the night sky and intrusion into private space caused by artificial lighting. Like other forms of pollution, it has a detrimental effect on human health, the environment, and society. For example, where there is abundant light pollution there is also wasted energy. When light meant to illuminate a road or path escapes upward or outward where its not needed, that means some of this energy is wasted.\r\n\r\nAccording to the **\"International Dark Sky Association (IDA)\":http://www.darksky.org/mc/page.do**, the limiting astronomical observing magnitude for the Lansing area is about 4-5. This means that objects dimmer than magnitude 5, including much of the Milky Way, are not visible. However, the effects of light pollution are not limited to what we can see in the night sky. Light pollution also affects us and the life around us.  For example the production of many hormones is moderated by light, including melatonin, the primary hormone of day/night cycle called the circadian cycle. The reduction in melatonin production caused by lighting is thought to have numerous physiological consequences, including the possibility of an increased risk of breast cancer in women. A good source to start learning about the effects of lighting is Kristen Navara and Randy Nelson’s article, **\"The Dark Side of Light at Night Physiological Epidemiological and Ecological Consequences\":http://www.psy.ohio-state.edu/nelson/documents/JPinealRes2007.pdf**(pdf) published in the Journal of Pineal Research in 2007.  A less rigorous description of the effects light pollution can be found in an **\"article\":http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/11/light-pollution/klinkenborg-text/1** published in National Geographic Magazine in November of 2008.\r\n\r\n**\"Reducing light pollution\":http://www.darksky.org/mc/page.do?sitePageId=58823#Street%20Lighting** is a multi-step process which requires the work of not just city planners but home and business owners as well. Steps homeowners can take include using dimmer lights, shutting blinds at night, and turning off lights when they are not needed. Business owners can likewise save their businesses money and reduce light pollution by using only the required amount of light needed to illuminate their businesses at night and making smart choices in light fixtures. City planners are in an excellent position to reduce light pollution. By selecting light fixture designs which direct light downward less light is wasted and dimmer bulbs can be used for lighting, saving energy and money. Prudent selection of light sources can also help reduce light pollution. New technologies like LEDs produce directed light and also use much less energy than currently used models.\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-25 02:24:08','2009-04-30 23:00:01',13,7,NULL,NULL),(28,'DenseMixedUse','Urban Infill Development and Community Needs','Keri Gardner','Urban infill development can be defined as conversion of old buildings and facilities into new uses (redevelopment) or by filling undeveloped spaces within these areas.

This was true in 1965 when MSU adjunct faculty member John Hesse of the Fisheries and Wildlife department first researched it and said it was the “dirtiest river you’ve ever seen.”1 Yet much is being done in order to improve the cleanliness of the water that flows down the river from East Lansing to Lansing.  The Ingham Conservation District (ICD) coordinated a more than $50,000 project to improve and create a buffer space along the Red Cedar between Lansing and East Lansing.2  Buffer spaces are vegetation areas along a body of water that helps filter and collect the urban runoff which can include pollutants.  The ICD worked with MSU, the Lansing Board of Water and Light and the City of Lansing and created about “500 feet of urban buffers.”2  With this environmental consciousness being expressed by our city leaders, a more individual awareness must follow.\r\n\r\n	In order to fight the Red Cedar’s reputation of pollution, students in the MSU Water group are taking action in improving this reputation as well as ensuring a clean and healthy future for the river.  The MSU Water group’s website not only discusses what they are attempting to do in order to improve the cleanliness of the river, but also what individuals can do.3  It is not necessary that we pay money to recycling companies or environmental cleaning agencies in order to improve this landmark whose name is heard in the MSU fight song.  What is necessary is action by all Lansing and East Lansing people.  The river can be clean as long as we take the proper action.  There needs to be concern and care in regards to the health of the Red Cedar because it has been an attraction not only to MSU students but also residents of Lansing and East Lansing.\r\n\r\n	Taking it upon ourselves as residents to clean and keep clean the Red Cedar has obvious benefits.  Not only would this river be aesthetically pleasing, but also could attract even more use.  Having a landmark that is clean would portray a positive image on the cities of Lansing and East Lansing and therefore would result in the use and reuse of this area.  Activities such as swimming would no longer be frowned upon because of the river’s reputation and therefore would create a whole new image and social atmosphere to not only MSU but also Lansing.  This would attract all demographics of people and promote the diversity that the Creative Class so longs for.  Most importantly, it costs nothing to simply be aware and help keep this river clean.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n\r\n1.

The walk-ability to these needs should allow walking, skating, or biking to find everything you need.  Mixed-use buildings with businesses below housing and office space intermingled between residential floors would allow access to services and needs.  Easy access to transportation for work and school can provide a livable urban environment attractive to new residents. \r\n\r\n  Several community infill projects have met with great success around the nation.  An example of one such community can be found by <a href=\"http://www.station-plaza.com/AboutUs/tabid/96/Default.aspx\">clicking here</a> and this multiuse community was built where an abandoned Target store was located.  This type of creative building has a new urban future.  Another example of a walkable community is Legacy Town Center in Dallas, Texas.

Pocket parks are defined as small spaces (usually smaller than 1000 square feet, or the size of a quarter-acre) within urban areas.  These parks can have many uses, from a  place of benches and tables were people can enjoy a coffee and a newspaper, to swing sets and sandboxes, creating an area where children can play.   Michigan Avenue has many lots around its corridor which currently hold barely filled parking lots or empty storefronts.  With proper planning and the right group of volunteers, pocket parks can be installed in those areas, creating a park-filled Michigan Avenue Corridor.\r\n\r\nA pocket parks success is tied to a few select traits.  One of the most obvious traits to consider in installing a pocket park is its location.  Most successful pocket parks are placed in areas of high pedestrian traffic, as to maximize their visibility and use.  For the greatest benefit to the corridor, the parks should be situated on Michigan Avenue to be visible to the greatest amount of traffic.  Another factor involved in planning a pocket park is the needs of its users.  Good pocket parks will be able to accommodate several different uses (for example, playground equipment for children and tables for workers wanting a quick bite to eat on their lunch hours) without being cluttered.  Lastly, the frequency of pocket parks in a given area is a critical trait; too many parks and the space will go unused, while too few parks will cause the park to be overcrowded.\r\n\r\n     The construction of pocket parks in Lansing will be tied to the previous characteristics.  To construct these parks, many different groups will have be partners in their construction and maintenance.  In pocket park construction, a neighborhood group organizes and typically assumes the task of maintaining the park.  The City of Lansing could also assume some of the burden as well, along with businesses near the park and civic groups, such as the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.  These groups would perform the lawn mowing, weeding, sweeping, and other duties necessary to keep the park clean.  With a little bit of work and cooperation, about any place can be converted into a pocket park, which can be a center for enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\"Pocket Parks - the Basics\":http://depts.washington.edu/open2100/pdf/2_OpenSpaceTypes/Open_Space_Types/pocket_parks.pdf – A document published about the basics of pocket parks (requires Adobe Acrobat Reader).\r\n\r\n\"Constructing a Pocket Park\":http://minnesota.publicradio.org/about/mpr/park/ - A website detailing the creation and blueprints of a pocket park in Minnesota, highlighting how a pocket park is developed.\r\n\r\n\"Cooley Gardens\":http://www.cooleygardens.org/ - Website of Cooley Gardens, a 1 acre pocket park in Lansing.

They are run by incubator management and vary in ways they deliver their services, which may include (but are not limited to) rental space with flexible leases, technology, and basic business services and equipment. Incubators may service large-scale projects, small business development centers, or even virtual clients. With an 87% survival rate and 84% continuing to do business in their local regions, incubators create jobs, reanimate neighborhoods, commercialize new technologies, and strengthen both local and national economies.

The incubator gave Martek access to specialized facilities and equipment that served as a pilot development lab for its early products. This product is now available in 60 countries worldwide and has license agreements with thirteen infant formula manufacturers, representing more than two-thirds of the world’s infant formula market. \r\n\r\nSmall business incubators tend to attract entrepreneurs who could benefit from the special assistance, which which incubator services provide during the early stages of development. Utilizing a business incubator is much more efficient – and generally more successful – than other means of pursuing entrepreneurship.

Passengers all have their own motives for choosing alternative transportation – economic reasons, environmental concerns, medical conditions, or just to simplify their commutes. Properly lighting bus stops and roadsides, correctly paving and orienting curbs to facilitate bus boarding, and access to emergency contacts should be standard practices of all transit systems and public places.\r\n\r\nProviding public transit users with a sense of pride and peace of mind while riding is vital to improving the area and the business. Educating the public on capabilities and duties of the system by including handicap access, clear and updated schedules and maps, and well-researched and constructed routes will give people confidence and more incentive to use public transportation.\r\n\r\nIncreasing the aesthetic appeal of bus stops along the corridor could improve the area for residents, visitors, and commuters alike. By making stops themselves more appealing - whether it’s a structure or merely a sign - implementing a great design can enhance experiencing public transportation as well as create an identity for the area. Branding the area as a safe, stylish, community-oriented, eco-friendly place would positively affect the region as a whole, bringing up property value and accelerating business and investment.\r\n\r\n*Useful Links:*\r\n\"Project for Pubic Spaces - Bus Shelter Overview\":http://www.pps.org/civic_centers/info/placemaking/amenities_bb/Bus_Shelters\r\n\"Personal Safety and the Transit Environment\":http://www.cts.umn.edu/pdf/CTS-02-05-all.pdf\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-25 23:37:23','2009-05-01 00:36:39',31,4,NULL,NULL),(47,'Streetscape','Bus Stops With Flair - Safety ','Ainsley Elder','*Safety*\r\n\r\n_Sidewalk and Traffic Modifications_ <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Buskap_notext.jpg\" border=0><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Buskap_notext.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a bus nub.\" width=\"309\" HEIGHT=\"115\"  align=right  /></a>\r\n\r\nThere are many ways in which well-designed bus stops can increase passenger safety. On a basic level, proper placement of stops along a road can prevent passengers from boarding in dangerous situations, such as installing stops near intersections or too close to the curb.  Bus bulbs, also known as bus nubs or bus boarders, is an extension which occupies the parking lane and allows a bus to pull up to the sidewalk directly.  Extending the sidewalk in this manner rather than the traditional curb-side bus stop or bus bay occupies fewer parking spaces, limits walking distance for pedestrians, reduces stop-time for buses, and provides more space for passengers to wait. Bus bulbs are much safer for traffic, as the bus has no reason to change lanes or merge in and out of traffic.\r\n\r\n_Lighting_\r\nFor years, both common sense and studies have taught us that proper lighting in neighborhoods and public areas not only deters crime, but can inspire homeowners and pedestrians to report crimes more frequently.  Providing adequately-lit areas both inside and outside of homes, retailers, office buildings, parks, etc. significantly reduces fear of these areas and may increase utility. In past studies, the cost of providing new lighting is far less than the cost of the crime deterred.  A recent innovation is the use of solar panels, which store energy from the sun during the day and run the lighting through the night. This is a good solution because the energy source is self-contained and requires no connections to a local power service.\r\n\r\n_Emergency Phones_ <a href=\"http://www.itsdocs.fhwa.dot.gov/jpodocs/repts_te/13477_files/Sec4.10_Description.jpg\" border=0><img src=\"http://www.itsdocs.fhwa.dot.gov/jpodocs/repts_te/13477_files/Sec4.10_Description.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of a call box.\" width=\"234\" HEIGHT=\"288\"  align=right  /></a>\r\n Providing a “call box” or emergency phone has similar benefits to good lighting – decreasing fear, increasing crime reports, etc. Many cities have installed wireless two-way radio call boxes.  They function very simply – once the button is pressed, a coded numeric signal is sent to the desired location (bus station, police station, hospital, etc.) and help is immediately deployed. In situations where the person requiring assistance may not be able to provide a clear explanation of the situation or their location, a direct connection to help is very important. Other varieties of emergency phones can be found in parking garages and on many college campuses. Some utilize the one-button function where vocal communication is optional and others have a keypad allowing the user to call a desired number for help.\r\n\r\n*Useful Links:*\r\n\"Effectiveness of Bus Nubs for Bus Stops\":http://www.transportation.njit.edu/NCTIP/research/ResRep.asp?status=Completed&projectNo=111&grantNumber=992530\r\n\"Lighting Up For Crime - An Overview on the Theory of Effective Lighting\":http://drdoall.com/lighting_up.htm\r\n\"Two-Way Radio Callbox Increases Public Safety\":http://news.thomasnet.com/fullstory/23245\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-25 23:42:42','2009-05-01 00:36:39',31,2,NULL,NULL),(49,'Cooperation','Collaboration with Local Economic Development Corportations','Steph Carlisle','*The Vital First Steps: Growing and Retaining Business*\r\n<table class=\"image styled\" \r\nalign=\"right\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5em\"\r\ncellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n<caption align=\"bottom\">Stadium District Development Made Possible by Brownfield Tax Incentives<br><br></caption>\r\n<tr><td><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ascribehq.com/assets/photos/large/c80220858fb8bb9eefd72c89fbbfe9d9ad9e56a1.jpg\"><img title=\"TITLE OF IMAGE\" src=\"http://www.ascribehq.com/assets/photos/large/c80220858fb8bb9eefd72c89fbbfe9d9ad9e56a1.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"The Stadium District\" align=\"right\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\"  /></a></td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<big><big><big>I</big></big></big>mprovement of the Michigan Avenue Corridor is heavily dependent on cooperation and collaboration between individuals, business owners, the university, and local and state governments. There is a wealth of tax incentives and initiatives available to start, grow and retain the businesses that keep Lansing thriving, and will breathe new life into the Corridor. The many economic development organizations in the area make these incentives easily accessible to those seeking to develop and improve Lansing. They serve as business advocates who aim to promote migration and retention, and act as an essential liaison between businesses and all areas of the government. There are opportunities for many different types of assistance regardless of the nature of the business although an increasing number are designed to target technology-based industries. The goal here is to close the gap that previously existed between Michigan State University, in East Lansing, and the once heavily industrial city of Lansing. Providing incentives to businesses of all kinds is the vital first step. Businesses create jobs and internships that help retain graduates. These graduates revitalize the workforce, contribute new ideas, demand better housing accommodations and entertainment venues, and most importantly--spend money. \r\n\r\n\r\n*Tax Incentives to Start or Grow a Business*\r\n    \r\nThere are many tax incentives that are particularly attractive to Corridor developers and entrepreneurs such as Brownfield Single Business Tax Credits, Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Credits, Michigan Job Creation Incentives, and Property Tax Abatements. These incentives are beneficial not only to business owners in Lansing, but also to the city at large. There is a mutually beneficial relationship between the two because businesses are able to utilize capital that might have been collected in taxes, and the city reaps the benefits from accomplishing its developmental and economic goals. Brownfield and Obsolete Property (OPRA) incentives allow for the redevelopment of buildings and land that may not have otherwise been developed because of the excessive costs involved in the clean-up or decontamination of these sites. The tax incentives make rehabilitation much more affordable and attractive for the developer, and increase the overall value of the property which benefits the city in the long run. A Property Tax Abatement is another incentive that will benefit Corridor investors. It essentially exempts a developer from taxes on a technology-related investments such as buildings, rehabilitation process for buildings, or piece of machinery. These abatements as well as Michigan Job Creation Incentives benefit the very technologically based companies that the Corridor hopes to attract.\r\n\r\n!http://farm1.static.flickr.com/86/248699501_b86ecee05d.jpg! Redevelopment of the Former Ottawa Power Station as the New Headquarters of the Accident Fund Insurance Agency\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Collaborating with Economic Development Organizations and Initiatives*\r\n\r\nCollaboration with regional and local development organizations provides businesses with essential advice and access to the incentives available for development along the Corridor. The most prominent among these organizations are the Michigan and Lansing Economic Development Corporations (MEDC and LEDC), as well as initiatives such as Lansing Regional SmartZones and Linking Lansing & U. The MEDC and LEDC aid businesses in deciding which incentives to pursue, assist in the process of securing those incentives, and serve as a liaison to the local and state governments. The SmartZone and Linking Lansing & U initiatives both focus on attracting technology related businesses and students who comprise the emerging “creative class”. This collaboration is crucial in the redevelopment of the Michigan Avenue Corridor to provide much needed incentives for business growth and retention and to ensure that the needs of the lucrative creative class continue to be met. \r\n\r\nSuggested sources for further information are the \"Michigan Economic Development Corporation\":http://www.themedc.org website and the \"Lansing Economic Development Corporation\":http://www.cityoflansingmi.com/invest/index.jsp website.

Brownfield redevelopment is touted as the premier model for redevelopment in the United States as the information and technology economy replaces the manufacturing and industrial economy. Brownfield describes certain commercial or industrial properties in the area that have specific redevelopment obstacles. These sites are designated \"Brownfield\" because they are either contaminated, require an extensive cleanup process, or are obsolete structures. \r\n\r\n	As a result of its industrial history, Lansing and other formerly industrial and manufacturing-based cities have many \"Brownfield\" sites and thus a greater advantage for receiving tax credits and incentives for redeveloping these sites. The Michigan and Lansing Economic Development Corporations (MEDC and LEDC) have made the redevelopment of these sites a high priority and tax incentives are available to offset 12.5- 20 percent of the total cost of eligible investments. Among current development projects in Lansing that have benefited from the receipt of Brownfield incentives are the historic Ottawa Street Power Station--the new home and headquarters of the Accident Fund Insurance Company and Gene Townsends proposed mixed-use project, the Kalamazoo Gateway. Additionally, Townsend’s project is proposed to be LEED certified for its energy efficiency and eco-friendliness. Other projects receiving Brownfield incentives include the Gillespie Group’s completed Stadium District development.   \r\n	\r\n*Rehabilitation with OPRA and Historic Preservation Incentives*\r\n	\r\n	Other crucial incentives for development in conjunction with the LECD and MEDC include Historic Preservation Tax Credits available through the State Historic Preservation Office and the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act (OPRA). OPRA encourages businesses to redevelop obsolete properties in exchange for a \"frozen\" tax rate. This tax rate will remain at the present rate (before redevelopment) for a maximum of 12 years, with the length of the abatement determined by the City of Lansing. This allows the developer an increased cash flow during development, the ability to pass these savings along to prospective tenants and businesses, and improved financing rates or terms due to the decreased liability of the property. \r\n\r\n	The State Historic Preservation Office also offers tax incentives and grants for redeveloping historic sites in the city. Developers who are eligible receive a single business tax credit for up to 25 percent of their income, as well as state tax credits. The recent renovation of downtown Lansings Mutual Building by the Christman Company was only possible with the receipt of state and federal historic preservation tax credits, as well as a combination of Brownfield incentives and the establishment of an OPRA district.\r\n\r\n*Read More About Brownfields and Incentives:*\r\n\r\n\"The MEDC and Brownfields\":http://www.themedc.org/Products-Services/Community-Assistance/Brownfields/Default.aspx\r\n\r\n\"LEDCs Brownfield Redevelopment Authority\":http://ref.michiganadvantage.org/cm/attach/F838D17C-7032-40BF-9431-098562FB3C07/BrownfieldRedevelopmentAuthorityPA381.pdf \r\n\r\n\"Brownfield Site in East Lansing, Mixed Use Facility\":http://www.pmenv.com/pm_pp_BrownfieldRedevelopmentFormerEastLansingDPW.htm\r\n\r\n\"Granholm on Brownfields 2006: East Lansing\":http://ref.michigan.org/medc/news/major/combo.asp?ContentId=C94B2A39-F021-4BF3-B1CC-71DB687C9198&QueueId=1&ContentTypeId=7',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-26 15:10:39','2009-04-30 23:56:28',9,4,NULL,NULL),(51,'Cooperation','Obtaining Advice and Access Through Economic Development Organizations','Steph Carlisle','*The Michigan Economic Development Corporation*\r\n	\r\nThe MEDC is an invaluable resource for businesses seeking tax abatements and incentives to develop along the Michigan Avenue Corridor. It was founded in 1999 by the state of Michigan and Michigan cities to fulfill a common need for a liaison between the state and private enterprise. The government was seeking businesses to develop Michigan cities and to take advantage of the incentives it provides, and businesses were seeking assistance in the process of acquiring these incentives.   \r\n\r\nThe MEDC is on the cutting edge of the new information economy, an essential element to both the Corridor and the City of Lansing. This organization recognizes the crucial role that incentives play in attracting new business to the Corridor, and has developed a strategic plan to help Lansing make the transition from an industrial city to a creative one by making these incentives accessible and available to the private sector.  This plan involves incentives for businesses that create new jobs, redevelop obsolete sites, contribute to the information economy, and create energy-efficient and environmentally friendly workplaces and products.\r\n\r\n*The Lansing Economic Development Corporation*\r\n\r\nThe Lansing Economic Development Corporation is a nonprofit organization with much the same mission as the MEDC. It offers opportunities for business creation, growth, and retention through incentives specifically designed for the city of Lansing. The LEDC has particular expertise in Brownfield redevelopment, and operates the city’s Brownfield Redevelopment Authority, which provides access to an archive of available sites to suit nearly any business. The Authority also provides assistance in obtaining state and federal grants and loans, as well as tax incentives to develop these properties.  \r\n\r\nCooperation, consultation and collaboration with the MEDC and LEDC will secure a sound competitive advantage for any business along the Corridor, new or existing. Their commitment to combining efforts with other economic development organizations in the region, as well as nearby universities like Michigan State ensure that businesses are able to take advantage of every available opportunity.  \r\n\r\n*Read More About Local Development Projects:*\r\n\r\n\"City Market Redevelopment\":http://www.lansingcitypulse.com/lansing/article-2206-a-long-road.html\r\n\r\n\"Projects (Kalamazoo Gateway, Christman and City Market) Using Brownfields and Tax Incentives\":http://www.capitalgainsmedia.com/devnews/default.aspx?referrerID=fbce1ca4-4d52-4248-90c8-1d38b1b5f46d&year=2007\r\n\r\n\"The Christman Company\":http://www.christmanco.com/stories.asp?id=17\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-26 15:11:52','2009-04-29 18:53:05',9,0,NULL,NULL),(52,'Cooperation','“Way-finding” Your Way Through the Corridor','Steph Carlisle','<table class=\"image styled\" \r\nalign=\"right\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5em\"\r\ncellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n<caption align=\"bottom\">Lansing River Trail Wayfinding Sign<br><br></caption>\r\n<tr><td><br />\r\n<a href=\"httphttp://farm4.static.flickr.com/3131/2790895898_a098d27745.jpg?v=0\"><img title=\"Matt Brinkey at Gone Wired Cafe\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3131/2790895898_a098d27745.jpg?v=0\" \r\nalt=\"Lansing River Trail Wayfinding Sign\" align=\"right\" width=\"200\" height=\"260\"  /></a></td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<big><big><big>T</big></big></big>here is hardly a successful and creative city that doesn’t have an equally successful and creative wayfinding system. While cities’ meandering streets, roundabouts, and literally “hidden” gems may be a source of pride for lifelong residents, the same can be unnerving for visitors and new residents, particularly in a city like Lansing or East Lansing which has so much to offer. But easy navigation to a city’s main points-of-interest is just one benefit of a well-constructed wayfinding system. Wayfinding systems are more than simply signage; they are a comprehensive and interconnected scheme of visual cues that create a clear identity for a city or area, making it more functional and accessible. Successful wayfinding projects allow visitors to easily navigate points-of-interest, but do not diminish the integrity of a citys architecture or character for longtime residents. Taking clear steps to integrate an effective wayfinding system will add value to the Corridor for years to come, overcoming any costs involved.\r\n\r\n*Steps to Effective Corridor Wayfinding*\r\n	\r\nBased out of Traverse City, Michigan, Corbin Design is a leader in the wayfinding industry.

The companys unique knowledge and history in the state of Michigan makes them an excellent source for addressing wayfinding along Corridor. They have completed many valuable projects in Michigan cities such as Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor, Royal Oak, Traverse City, and Kalamazoo.

This positive experience will encourage new ventures in the city and increased mobility throughout Lansing, East Lansing and the Corridor. Wayfinding combines various elements such as landscape, architecture, design, signage, graphics and city amenities to create a uniform identity for an area. You know when you enter and leave the city because of it. Another important element to Lansings wayfinding program will be working from the outside in, meaning that highways and inroads to the city will be a part of the system. Creating a homogeneous identity that both Lansing and East Lansing share with the Corridor is no small task; however, the rewards, if executed effectively, will completely diminish the initial costs involved.   \r\n\r\nSuggested sources for further reading include \"Corbin Designs\":http://www.corbindesign.com/ website and online portfolio.

Initiatives are generally undertakings by an organization to achieve a desired outcome. Such desired outcomes include fresh approaches to situations or processes, instituting a moneysaving operation, or increasing the overall well-being of an organization. Current initiatives in Lansing with similar goals will immensely benefit the Corridor project, especially Lansing Regional SmartZones and the Linking Lansing & U initiative. Both aim to attract and retain technology-based enterprises, and technologically savvy students and recent alumni.        \r\n\r\n*SmartZones*\r\n\r\nA major goal for the Michigan Avenue Corridor is to provide a solid link between Lansing and East Lansing, between students and permanent residents, and between university and industry or private enterprise. The Lansing Regional SmartZone initiative seeks to bridge that gap in a way that merely filling the Corridor with new commerce alone cannot. It is a collaboration between the two cities, the university, and many other groups to expand technology-based ventures. This initiative supplies necessary capital to incorporate university research and resources and information technology companies in the area, and allows for a more fluid relationship between the two. SmartZones, \r\n“stimulate the growth of technology-based businesses and jobs by aiding in the creation of recognized clusters of new and emerging businesses.

These events allow students to see Lansing first hand from an individual who lives, works, and thrives along the Corridor and in the city while showcasing available opportunities. This, in conjunction with the SmartZones initiative will address members of the creative class in a way that business and tax incentives alone cannot.    \r\n\r\n\r\n*Read More About Grants, Initiatives, and Incentives:*\r\n\r\n\"MEDC Tax Incentives\":http://ref.themedc.org/cm/attach/D436FA5F-5388-493F-B5FE-3E5BE290F297/Michigan_Business_Development_Services.pdf\r\n\r\n\"SHPO: State Historic Preservation Office\":http://www.michigan.gov/hal/0,1607,7-160-17445_19273_19318---,00.html\r\n\r\n\"Job Creation Tax Credits\":http://ref.michigan.org/medc/services/financial/combo.asp?ContentId=85376A88-2715-4D48-89A5-AD81A39B717E&QueueId=1&ContentTypeId=10002/services/financial/combo.asp\r\n\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-26 15:16:06','2009-04-29 18:53:05',9,15,NULL,NULL),(54,'Cooperation','Steps to Effective Corridor Wayfinding','Steph Carlisle','    \r\nCorbin Designs steps to effective wayfinging is a great model containing key considerations that can be applied to any wayfinding program. The goal throughout these steps is to utilize available resources such as architecture and existing landscape to develop a system that appears almost naturally occurring. This allows visitors to utilize information that has been simplified into visual cues, while not distracting or overwhelming residents.\r\n\r\n*Vital First Steps*\r\n\r\nThe first step is to ensure user participation and community input. This includes the possibly creation of a Political Action Committee (PAC) to represent citizens and serve as a liaison between the design company, the community, organizations, and the local government. Information should also be available to all who seek it through town hall style meetings, online forums, and a website designed to provide information on the progress of the project. This allows citizens to help in the design process, deciding which points-of-interest to use, how to provide directions to pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and how to best phrase terminology for optimal understanding. The design should at its most basic point; help a first-time visitor easily navigate the area and main points-of-interest. This means highlighting parking, shopping, government offices and cultural areas that receive the most traffic. Attention must be paid to those traveling either as a pedestrian, or by car, as sign placement and height will be different for each. \r\n\r\n*Securing Success*\r\n\r\nWayfinding systems are most successful when they support individuals intuition. Lansing most identifies itself most heavily as the capital of Michigan, and East Lansing with the University, so it will be necessary to incorporate those ideas intuitively in the Corridor wayfinding program. The signage should also support intuition and be presented in a hierarchical manner. This means taking into consideration that most individuals will want to access the Corridor, downtown area, or parking before other destinations. Signs can be designed to list point-of-interest, with consistent directions to parking or downtown on each sign. This lets the visitor get an idea of where to go after parking their car or finding their way downtown, and avoids the frustration of not knowing where to park. \r\n\r\nThe system should also attempt to control circulation and traffic, encouraging the use of safe and main roads. This mitigates disruption of neighborhoods, and helps visitors remember main routes, acclimating them with the area. \r\n\r\nLastly, the system needs to be tested and evaluated for effectiveness. A number of mock-ups should be placed exactly as planned, and user feedback should be collected from both visitors to the area, as well as longtime residents. This assures that any shortcomings can be addresses with limited cost, and allows the agreement within the community as a whole, creating a sense of ownership and pride for the system.      \r\n\r\n*Check Out These Links for More about Effective Wayfinding Systems:*\r\n\r\n\"Springfield, Missouri $600,000 Wayfinding Project\":http://www.news-leader.com/article/2009902110464\r\n\r\n\"Lansings Guidelines for Wayfinding Design, Walking, Biking Projects\":http://www.midmeac.org/files/NMT_DESIGNGUIDELINES.pdf\r\n\r\n\"Wayfinding Systems: Critical Components and Effective Design\":http://www.gwlrealtyadvisors.com/gwlra/CNTAsset/Wayfinding%20Systems%20(English%20Version).pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-26 15:18:41','2009-04-29 18:53:05',9,0,NULL,NULL),(55,'Cooperation','Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Wayfinding Systems','Steph Carlisle','An effective and thoroughly executed wayfinding project is no small undertaking, nor is it cheap. Projects can range anywhere from $50,000 to $600,000 and beyond. In addition to that number, there are additional costs to be considered including educating the public about the endeavor, marketing the project, holding town hall meetings, and creating an informational website for community feedback. These additional costs have deterred cities in the past from instituting wayfinding systems, or have led them to take shortcuts in the process, downsizing the scope of the project, and drastically reducing its effectiveness. \r\n	\r\n*Creating Lasting Value*\r\n\r\nWhat these cities sometimes fail to consider is the continued value that wayfinding systems offer the community. Not only will this benefit the Corridor by creating clear points-of-interest and destinations, but it will provide a tangible and visual link between East Lansing and Lansing. Wayfinding systems also increase and maintain visitor traffic, shopping, and tourism to the area, which generates profitable returns for many cities that rely on sales tax revenues. They create a positive environment among residents and visitors alike by taking the work out of finding ones way.\r\n\r\nAccording to Paul Arthur and Romedi Passini in their book Wayfinding: People, Signs, and Architecture, good quality wayfinding promotes the following: reduction of stress and frustration for the visitor, functionality efficiency, visitor accessibility, safety, visitor empowerment, improving cognitive skills in, spatial understanding, and improved bottom line. As similar study by Carpman and Grant in 2001 found an important relationship between disorientation and design, \"Stress caused by disorientation may result in feelings of helplessness, raised blood pressure, headaches, increased physical exertion, and fatigue\". Keeping in mind the immense value that a wayfinding system will add to the Corridor will help reconcile what might seem an extraordinary undertaking at the outset. \r\n\r\n*Check Out These Links for More on the Costs and Benefits of Wayfinding Systems:*\r\n\r\n\"Corbin Design Wayfinding Newsletters\":http://www.corbindesign.com/point-of-view/newsletters/index.html\r\n\r\n\"Wayfinding and the Numbers: Harrisonburg, VA\":http://hburgnews.com/2008/12/09/new-wayfinding-signs-in-the-city/\r\n\r\n\"City of Hudsonville Declines Wayfinding Project, Too Expensive\":http://www.mlive.com/grandvalleyadvance/index.ssf/2009/01/wayfinding_sign_proposal_defea.html\r\n\r\n\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-26 15:20:49','2009-04-29 18:53:05',9,1,NULL,NULL),(56,'Cooperation','Comparing Models for Successful Wayfinding','Steph Carlisle','When constructing a wayfinding plan or program it is essential that the city, the community, and the designers keep in mind the unique characteristics of the area. This ensures that the wayfinding system makes sense and adds to this identity rather than detracting from it. Different cities have different needs. For example, an enormous urban area such as downtown Los Angeles will require a more extensive pedestrian signage network than say, a city in Michigan that requires more vehicular transportation. The success of the wayfinding system is dependent on recognizing what aspects of Lansing and the Michigan Avenue Corridor will need to be accommodated and accentuated. \r\n\r\n*Model 1: Downtown Los Angeles, CA*\r\n\r\nLos Angeles is known as a tourist destination, entertainment hub, and hip residential area. This makes for a very pedestrian-accessible downtown area. As a tourist destination, wayfinding signs are crucial to promote and maintain that industry. Tourists must be able to easily navigate the area, including 350 city blocks, 50 streets, more than 300 intersections, 30 freeway off-ramps and eight transit stops. Over the course of five years between 2000 and 2005, Los Angeles instituted a comprehensive $2 million wayfinding system. The initial goal of the project was to improve bus and subway systems, making them easier to find and navigate and reducing the amount of vehicle traffic in the process. The project expanded to create thirteen unique districts that were recognized by residents which were then color-coded each with its own wayfinding group that reflected the overall theme for Los Angeles. \"The icons became key elements in the resulting signage program—featured on the more than 1,300 vehicular and pedestrian directional signs and street corner maps that make up the system.\" For these efforts, the project was honored with the 2007 Jury Award by The Society for Environmental Graphic Design.\r\n\r\n*Model 2: Downtown Grand Rapids, MI*\r\n\r\nGrand Rapids, Michigan is another thriving downtown area that benefited from the development of a wayfinding system. The city is unique with names of some streets ending in \"northwest\" or \"southwest\" which can be confusing for visitors, as well as many one-way streets and those that bend strangely in order to follow along the Grand River. In the process of creating a wayfinding system, the city created four districts, each with its own attractions and points-of-interest. Similar to Los Angeles, but on a much smaller scale, these districts were clearly color-coded and represented by symbols unique to each. The city also developed an extensive pedestrian network for visitors to the area for business and recreation, and display maps that show a five minute walking radius in all directions. This pedestrian wayfinding system will be a great model for the Corridor, as the Capitol and the university both attract visitors for business or pleasure. It will encourage foot traffic, keeping the vehicles on the road to a minimum, and active promotion and exploration of the Corridors offerings.     \r\n\r\n*Read More About Wayfinding Models and Effectiveness:*\r\n\r\n\"Los Angeles Unveils One Of The Countrys Most Comprehensive Civic Wayfinding Programs\":http://www.eworldwire.com/pdf/12224.pdf\r\n\r\n\"Questions to Ask About Wayfinding Projects\":http://www.urban-transportation-monitor.com/product/utmsurvey1912/\r\n\r\n\"Interactive Interior Wayfinding\":http://www.omnivex.com/press/articles/SignBuilder_November2007_FindingInteractiveDisplays.pdf\r\n\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-26 15:21:50','2009-04-29 18:53:05',9,0,NULL,NULL),(57,'Dense Mixed Use','Convenient Access to Daily Needs','Keri Gardner','To attract new residents to infill housing, convenient access is necessary for their daily needs.  The walk-ability to these needs should allow walking, skating, or biking to find everything you need.  Mixed-use buildings with businesses below housing and office space intermingled between residential floors would allow access to services and needs.  Easy access to transportation for work and school can provide a livable urban environment attractive to new residents. \r\n  Several community infill projects have met with great success around the nation.  An example of one such community can be found by <a href=\"http://www.station-plaza.com/AboutUs/tabid/96/Default.aspx\">clicking here</a> and this multiuse community was built where an abandoned Target store was located.

In New York City for example, many of their streets have multiple recycling bins. One recycling bin is for aluminum containers. Another is for plastic containers. And, there are even bins for newspapers and magazines. If somebody is done reading a newspaper, they can recycle it instead of throwing in the garbage or on the street. City officials in New York have reported that these bins have helped decrease the littering rates in the city. IN 2006, it was reported that 1.7 million tons of recyclables were collected.\r\n	These bins are green and blue. Blue represents cans, and green represents paper. 25,000 street corners in New York City have these green and blue bins. If this idea were to be adopted for the Michigan Avenue Corridor project, it could benefit for the Lansing area. Michigan Avenue would be the guinea pig. The bins could be placed on all of the street corners that are on the street. Once the city sees how this works, they will most likely be impressed, and decide to add them to the rest of the city corners. Lansing is not much to look at these days. However, that doesn’t mean it can’t be restored. It all starts with thinking and acting green. Once the public becomes more environmentally conscious, the city will look cleaner and have a more positive image. \r\n	Another example of recycling bins is in the city of Toronto. They have recycling bins all over the city as well. But most of the city’s bins are located throughout parks and forestry area. Besides keeping the city clean, they are keeping their parks clean as well. This goes to show that recycling bins can also be used in many recreational areas. For Michigan Avenue, not only could the street corners have these bins, but recreational areas can have them as well.

A successful transformation of the Michigan Avenue Corridor into such an area requires a downtown atmosphere that offers a comfortable, engaging and secure environment for pedestrians.   Though transportation within the corridor will be affected by both public and private modes, the ability for a pedestrian to navigate in a safe and efficient manner is crucial to the process of urban revitalization.\r\n\r\nWithin the corridor, a few innovative changes could serve to increase public safety and help to eliminate pedestrian hazards.  Such changes could be the utilization of pedestrian and traffic detection devices at crosswalks and traffic lights, an increase in pedestrian level street lighting and the implementation of a public/pedestrian safety committee.   With a newfound, or increased feeling of safety and security, it is the hope of many that the Michigan Avenue Corridor will one day be a creative city bustling with pedestrian activity.  \r\n\r\n!=/http://www.walkinginfo.org/pedsmart/webpics/geninfr.gif!\r\n\r\nPedestrian and traffic detection devices at crosswalks and traffic lights have been used in multiple cities around the country.  The following link, \"www.pbworld.com\":url, gives examples of areas in which such measures have been taken to improve pedestrian safety. It also gives a brief overview of some of the technology incorporated in the use of the various devices, providing visuals as well. \"www.walkinginfo.org\":url provides more detailed information regarding in-pavement lighting systems including two cities in which such systems have been implemented.  For more information on a functional pedestrian safety committee and the impact it has had on a local community please see \"www.ci.slc.ut.us\":url.\r\n\r\nThere are various strategies that could be implemented using pedestrian and traffic detection devices at crosswalks and traffic lights.  Devices that make use of infrared, microwave or video technologies are a more long-term and modern approach.  A short-term and cost-friendly alternative would be a simple crosswalk flag system in which pedestrians would carry a small brightly colored flag at crossings.  Both options could be implemented in different areas of the corridor depending on the frequency of pedestrian activity and traffic. \r\n\r\nThe use of an infrared detection system is one way to increase pedestrian safety.  In a specific area, usually the crosswalk and correlating curbs, these devices containing thermal radiation detectors can sense a change in heat when a person crosses or approaches a crossing.  Crossing time is then increased or decreased based on presence of pedestrians.   Microwave detection systems are another option.  These systems emit electromagnetic energy into a target area, or crosswalk.  If the device detects the energy being reflected in the crosswalk or curb, just like the infrared detector, it allows for more time to be given accounting for pedestrian crossing.  \r\n\r\nBoth infrared and microwave detection devices seem to be more modern and long-term solutions to decreasing pedestrian hazards throughout the corridor, however, implementation could serve to be costly and time consuming.  While the gradual process of installing these devices in the busiest and most dense pedestrian areas began, a simple, community oriented and cost-friendly option could be explored.  \r\n\r\nBrightly colored or reflective flags could be placed in containers on both ends of crosswalks.  Pedestrians would utilize the crosswalk flags by holding them as they crossed, making them stand out more to traffic.  In Salt Lake City, such a system has been adopted.  To keep the flag containers stocked, the city has created an “Adopt a Crosswalk” program in which local businesses pay to refill the flag containers and monitor them.\r\n\r\nFor more information on a vast array of pedestrian safety technology including the previously mentioned safety systems, please visit \"www.walkinginfo.org\":url. \r\n\r\nAnother option for enhancing pedestrian safety is to increase pedestrian level street lighting.  An increase in street lighting in general would serve to benefit the community. Well-lit areas are characteristically safer and less hazardous as far as accidents and crime are concerned.  In-pavement street lighting is becoming a common practice in many urban areas and has been implemented in around the country.  Such a system could provide a bright and less hazardous environment for people walking or biking in the Michigan Avenue Corridor. \r\n\r\nThe basic function of an in-pavement street lighting system is to alert approaching traffic to the presence of pedestrians.  Lights are placed on both sides of a crosswalk and angled toward oncoming traffic.  The lights flash when a pedestrian is using the crosswalk and continue to do so until an adequate crossing time has been allowed.  These systems can be used alongside infrared and microwave detection devices in order to make crossing time more accurate or extended based on individual pedestrian needs.\r\n\r\n!=/http://www.walkinginfo.org/pedsmart/webpics/genlytx2.gif!\r\n\r\nIn-pavement lighting systems are becoming relatively common in many urban areas.  In Pemberton, New Jersey, residents and school administrators employed such a system in order to minimize hazards to children in a school zone.  A specific crosswalk was targeted using an in-pavement system, as well as fluorescent stripping.  For more information on the success of this system in Pemberton, New Jersey, please see www.state.nj.us.  For more information on in-pavement lighting systems such as product information and installation please visit \"www.lightguardsystems.com\":url.\r\n\r\nImplementing a public/pedestrian safety committee is another way in which pedestrian safety could be enriched inside the Corridor.  A committee or group of local residents or commuters, who are familiar with the Michigan Avenue Corridor and its needs, would come together to ensure that the safest environment possible is provided.  Such a committee would be a public forum in which problems, safety issues and public/pedestrian hazards could be brought to the table.  \r\n	\r\nIn some areas, pedestrian safety committees are an extension of city council.  The committees function in response to problems, as well as taking a pre-emptive approach to trouble-shooting within the realm of pedestrian transportation.  Such committees are responsible for orchestrating safety precautions such as crosswalk flag systems, Adopt a Crosswalk, educational public campaigns and even implementation of enhanced law enforcement and street improvements to protect pedestrians.\r\n\r\nFor more information on active and successful public/pedestrian safety committees please visit the following links.

However, high-density should not be cause for worry unless the residents of these areas are restless or discontent with their surroundings.  The residents of high-density areas along the Michigan Avenue Corridor need to be able to enjoy a variety of activities and services that will leave them feeling anything but restless. Taken into account the vast range of household budgets, the following proposed activities offer a plentitude of options for youth and families. The proposed ideas for activity spaces are separated into three categories: a Healthy Lifestyles Gymnasium; an Arts, Music, and Games Center; and a Pro-Earth and Outdoor Recreation Station.\r\n\r\nThe Healthy Lifestyles Gymnasium is a top priority in catering to youth and families in high-residential areas. An important aspect to high-density communities is the availability of resources which incorporate worthwhile activities that are still fun for kids. Health and education are two subjects that should not be abandoned outside of school walls. While building a gymnasium will cost a community an upwards of $200 per square foot, promoting health in today’s youth is now a necessary investment. The activities that the Healthy Lifestyles Gymnasium will  provide include, but are not limited to: various sports teams; cardio and strength-training fun; healthy eating sessions; and seminars and classes that deal with healthy lifestyles and choices. The Gymnasium will cover an area of approximately 15,000 square feet. Membership fees will cater to family income.\r\n     \r\nThe Arts, Music, and Games (AMG) Center will provide surrounding youth with a chance to express themselves creatively and have loads of fun. Annual fees for the AMG Center will depend on a family’s income, as well. With admission to the Center, art, dance, theater, and music lessons are free (however, a child may enroll in only one lesson at a time). An arcade will also reside within the Center, where children and teens will have their choices at various games and fun activities. Admission into the arcade will require $5 per person every time. The AMG Center will be approximately 10,000 square feet and cost between $80 and $175 per square foot. Finally, the Pro-Earth and Outdoor Recreation Station (PEORS) will allow youth to get involved in cleaning up their communities and enjoying nature. The actual Station will be small, only 625 square feet or so, and will house information regarding Community Clean-up, Rent-a-Garden spaces, and Adopt-an-Animal services. The building will be surrounded by trails for walking, rollerblading, and biking. In the winter, the trails will be groomed for cross-country skiing and, in some areas, snowmobiling. \r\n\r\nFor more information regarding youth and healthy lifestyles, please visit \"Healthy Lifestyles\":http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3003754.

Such an area is characteristically rooted in community activity and interaction.  In order to transform the Michigan Avenue Corridor into a more creative and interactive neighborhood, measures to increase pedestrian movement and local interest are needed.  Increasing pedestrian traffic and transportation in terms of closeness and relation to relevant businesses, known as walkability, combined with navigation based on efficiency and modernization are ways of working toward urban renewal.  \r\n\r\nA few ways the Michigan Avenue Corridor could be enriched to offer extended walkability and better navigation would be to repair and extend sidewalks, curbs and crosswalks, use symbols and landmarks to distinguish certain areas and locations and to provide digital interactive map kiosks.  These steps would serve to encourage pedestrians to go out and about, as well as help them easily get to their destinations. \r\n\r\n\"www.maine.gov\":url links to a document based on “expanding and enhancing modes of transportation.  The information in the link describes the importance of appropriately sized sidewalk and crosswalk areas based on safety as well as easy navigation. The following YouTube video, shows direct interaction between a pedestrian and an interactive map kiosk.\r\n\r\nSidewalks, curbs and crosswalks should be extended or repaired in necessary areas within the Michigan Avenue Corridor in order to better fit the needs of the people that utilize them on a daily basis.  Sidewalk repair usually falls on the shoulders of the businesses that own the property adjacent to the sidewalks.  Increased pedestrian activity would be an incentive for local businesses to repair these areas.  Partial city funding and an encouraging incentive campaign could aid in the process.   \r\n\r\nRepair and extension is important because well-paved and easily accessible walking space is vital to enhancing and enabling a walker or biker’s experience.   “Walkable and attractive environments” play a crucial role in the appeal of a creative city.  Appropriately spaced sidewalks reduce crowdedness on busy streets and offer a freer range of mobility and movement for pedestrians.  Also, accurately labeled signs on crosswalks, corners or sidewalks would help direct pedestrians to their intended destinations.  \r\n\r\nCharacteristically, creative cities and functional urban atmospheres use sidewalk space and crosswalks for various reasons.  Commercial areas often require sidewalks on both sides of the street so that pedestrians can easily access businesses.  In these areas, extra space needs to be accounted for to accommodate “window-shopping”.  However, adequate sidewalk spacing is important in terms of efficiency and pace as well.  It is essential that pedestrians on a casual afternoon stroll do not impede those using the sidewalks as a means to get to work or those jogging or running.  Overall, sidewalks and crosswalks should be constructed, extended or repaired in order to put up with all the needs pedestrians in a creative city will have.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about appropriate use of sidewalks and crosswalks, please visit \"www.maine.gov\":url.  For insight on how these spaces have been altered to enhance the pedestrian experience in other cities, please see \"www.ci.nyc.ny.us\":url. \r\n\r\nThe use of symbols and landmarks to aid in navigation is a practice that goes back to the very beginnings of human transportation.  Various forms of architecture, statues or decorations could be constructed and used in order to differentiate between individual areas within the corridor.  These additions would serve to make certain locations more recognizable or familiar to pedestrians and to assist them in acclimating to and understanding their surroundings promptly.\r\n\r\nIn many cities, landmarks are located in numerous areas and can be used to help a pedestrian situate him or herself.  For instance, on Michigan State University’s Campus right here in Lansing, the Sparty Statue can be used to pinpoint one’s location in relation to Spartan Stadium, the Library, or position on campus in general.  As well as providing aesthetic appeal for pedestrians, landmarks like Sparty serve as navigational tools.  \r\n\r\nIn Canton, Michigan symbolic artwork and statues have been placed in front of various businesses and along streets and corners.  Though aesthetic and artistic appeal are definitely present here, the use of these pieces can be helpful in finding entrances to parking lots or businesses as well as specific streets.  Similar approaches could be taken within the Corridor, especially in the areas attractive to pedestrians such as Ranney Skatepark.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on the use of road art in Canton MI please visit \"http://www.canton-mi.org/arts/fordroad_art.aspx\":url.  \r\n\r\nDigital interactive map kiosks could be positioned in various points throughout the corridor in order to equip pedestrians with the necessary knowledge to navigate from place to place.  Whether an individual is searching for a business, a street corner or a bus stop, the interactive map kiosk would serve to link them to a computer navigation system that can basically give any information about the area that would be relevant or necessary.  Locations, addresses and directions to surrounding restaurants, gas stations, ATM’s, etc. would be at a pedestrian’s fingertips instantly.\r\n\r\nBy far the most expensive option for increasing the navigation within the corridor would be the implementation of the kiosk system.  These digital interactive map kiosks are very common in China.  They are built on a database of information and are designed to locate services, find phone numbers, names and provide detailed mapping of a region.   \r\n\r\nFor more information about digital interactive map kiosks please visit \"info.hktdc.com.\":url  To see the actual process of using one of the kiosks please view this YouTube video \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqYVS_6y8r4\":url  \r\n\r\n\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-29 20:18:23','2009-05-01 00:36:39',21,9,NULL,NULL),(70,'Dense Mixed Use','Plans for Seniors','Lori Bates','The idea that New Urbanism pertains to the revival of a city usually brings to mind the rise of a young, creative generation of people.  The fact is, many of the surrounding residents are not young; senior citizens make up a good portion of Mid-Michigan and the Lansing area, which is why they, too, fall into the category of High Density Development. Many of the younger generation are left scratching their heads over ways to benefit seniors in the development of the Michigan Avenue Corridor.  Fortunately, plans for senior citizens are underway.\r\n     \r\nAn assisted-living home will be provided in or near residential complexes for senior citizens. The proximity of this home will allow spouses and friends to have easy and convenient visitation. The assisted-living home will benefit those who are struggling with mental and/or physical disabilities, while also catering to the needs of the surrounding families. The assisted-living home will not provide patient rehab. A separate Rehab and Nursing Center will also reside in or near the assisted-living and residential complexes for senior citizens. This rehab center will benefit seniors who live either at the assisted home or independently. The rehab center will employ physical therapists, occupational therapists, and nurses. Again, the proximity of the rehab facility will help with the transportation of patients and those there to show support. The assisted living home and rehab center will cover areas of approximately 12,000 and 24,000 square feet, respectively. The cost of these medical facilities is approximately $250 per square foot.\r\n     \r\nFinally, a Senior Entertainment Center will be erected for the entertainment of surrounding senior citizens. Ideally, this Senior Center would also reside near residential complexes and assisted-living homes. The Senior Center will provide a variety of activities for visiting senior citizens, including senior-oriented exercise programs, film and television show screenings, arts and crafts, sewing and quilting, cooking and baking lessons, and more. The Senior Center will also cater to the elderly who cannot or do not wish to leave their homes. The Center will deliver meals weekly for only a small charge. As a borrowing service, books and movies may also be delivered for free. The Senior Entertainment Center will cover approximately 5,000 square feet. The cost for this public facility will be between $80 and $200 per square foot. \r\n\r\nFor more information regarding Assisted Living Homes and Senior Rehab Centers, see \"Assisted Living\":http://www.assistedlivinginfo.com/ and \"Senior Rehab\":http://www.parentgiving.com/articles/senior_rehab_and_the_healing_process/.\r\n','http://www.cgschmidt.com/images/category/senior.jpg','http://www.emoryhealthcare.org/Images/ww_images/senior-rehab.jpg','© CG Schmidt 2009','Emory Healthcare 2008.

Offering clear, proper iconography, and well-labeled maps will make using the transit system pleasant for patrons.  Strictly using a single, sans-serif font using proper capitalization and sentence case is very important. Negative space helps the eye organize chunks of information visually. Maintaining the same order of information on each sign is imperative, similar to the picture on the right. There is clear iconography noting a bus and that it’s handicapped-accessible, it notes what bus lines the stop serves, is clearly organized, and provides a logo and telephone number of the transit authority.\r\n\r\n_Distinctive signage_\r\nDesigning the signs to be as distinguishable as possible from other street signs will aid significantly, and help to brand the area and the transit system.  Including an odd shape, like a skewed triangle, elongated rectangle, or even an oval shape will differentiate the bus flags from road signs. Providing color combinations that are otherwise never seen on the road, like purple, green, or a light blue are good options and are unique and complimentary to each other. A well-defined combination of colors for a particular transit system will be recognized by passengers and other drivers instantly.  Making the important text on the signs as high-contrast and large as possible will help visibility from a distance.  Adding a beacon or a type of light to the top will make each signpost very noticeable, especially at night. Making the beacon a particular color and shape, like a cone or cylinder, will identify that area as a bus stop instantly and discern it from other lights near or on the road.\r\n\r\n_Schedules and Displays_<a href=\"http://www.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/bus_stop_3.jpg\" border=\"0\"><img src=\"http://www.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/bus_stop_3.jpg\" alt=\"A digital bus schedule.\" width=\"300\" HEIGHT=\"220\"  align=right  /></a>\r\nSimplifying and consistently including updated lists of schedule times is imperative. Bus routes tend to change regularly, and a common complaint among passengers is that the schedules provided at stops – if there even is one – is rarely up to date or easy to understand. Providing an updatable digital display would be extremely beneficial. Passengers waiting could also be notified of delays and how long they can expect to wait until the next bus arrives. Providing people with hard-information, rather than an estimate on a possible out-dated, static sign would improve the lives and transit experience for all.\r\n\r\n*Useful Links:*\r\n\"American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) Commonly-Used International Symbols\":http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/symbol-signs\r\n\"What and What Not To Do - Usability Testing in a MN Transit System\":http://www.tc.umn.edu/~hause011/article/Bus_ride7.html\r\n\"A Chinese-Designed Digital Bus Stop System\":http://www.nwtm.com.cn/en/show-cp.asp?id=341\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-30 04:13:04','2009-05-01 00:36:39',31,1,NULL,NULL),(72,'Streetscape','Bus Stops With Flair - Identity','Ainsley Elder','*Identity*\r\n\r\n_A “Green” Presence_<a href=\"http://energypriorities.com/graphs/torontoshelter.jpg\" border=0><img src=\"http://energypriorities.com/graphs/torontoshelter.jpg\" alt=\"A man waiting in a bus shelter.\" width=\"200\" HEIGHT=\"254\" hspace=\"10\"  align=right  /></a>\r\nCommunities in Oregon, Washington, Canada, England, and other locations all over the world are beginning to grasp the importance and benefits of using alternative energy – in particular, solar energy. Integrating solar panels would make each unit self-sufficient and dependable. Cities can save huge amounts of money by avoiding the civil and electrical engineering involved in wiring so many locations to a power grid. Even in notoriously overcast areas, these solar-powered systems work perfectly and can prevent thousands of pounds of carbon emissions per year and save the town thousands in electricity bills. Using this as inspiration, other businesses could adapt renewable \r\nenergy plans and yield a more eco-friendly community. \r\n\r\n_High-Tech Image_\r\nWhen viewed by passengers, commuters, and tourists certain designs could make the area more technologically relevant. Offering services like free wireless internet would appeal to those who are turned off by waiting on the bus for long trips. Allowing people to be entertained and productive during their commute would satisfy most modern passengers. In past applications, installing wi-fi on one bus costs from $1000-2000. For transit systems, a considerable amount of revenue is generated by advertisements. In an interactive, adaptable, digital environment, the possibility for multiple forms of advertisement is near endless. Ideas for this sort of engaging public transportation experience are being carried out at MIT and by other institutions.\r\n\r\n_A Public Transit Community_<a href=\"http://mobile.mit.edu/en/files/imagecache/medium_sized/media/images/busstop_10.png\" border=0><img src=\"http://mobile.mit.edu/en/files/imagecache/medium_sized/media/images/busstop_10.png\" alt=\"A strangely-designed bus shelter.\" width=\"285\" HEIGHT=\"254\"  align=right hspace=\"10\"  /></a>\r\nWell-designed, friendly, usable stops could become locally relevant, enjoyable, and increase ridership. A community with a sense of pride in their area is more cooperative and productive with one another. If the points mentioned above are carried out successfully, numbers of passengers would increase dramatically. Not only would people feel safer in a well-lit area, they will gain a sense of reliability from the transit system, knowing what buses will arrive when, and also feel that the transit system has their interests in mind. Success in this plan could bring national and international attention to the area and serve as a model for other cities.\r\n\r\n*Useful Links:*\r\n\"Case Study - Solar Transit Lighting Shines in the Cloudy Pacific Northwest\":http://energypriorities.com/entries/2005/08/carmanah_metro.php\r\n\"Wi-Fi and Public Transportation\":http://www.usatoday.com/tech/wireless/2008-04-10-wifi_N.htm\r\n\"Increasing Transit Ridership: Lessons from the Most Successful Transit Systems in the 1990s\":http://transweb.sjsu.edu/mtiportal/research/publications/documents/transitridership2/TransitRidership_7_16.htm\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-30 04:25:59','2009-05-01 00:36:39',31,1,NULL,NULL),(73,'DenseMixedUse','Incentives to Investors','Keri Gardner','If all the programs and infrastructure are present in a community it doesn’t mean that it will be attractive to investors.

Some of the challenges beyond community acceptance are as follows:  land acquisition and assembly difficulties, financing complexities, and regulatory constraints.  Many communities around the nation have conducted research to identify impediments and tools needed to revitalize urban centers. Making the areas attractive to hesitant investors can be a big undertaking.  Addressing the need for affordable housing, smart zoning, regional reforms and state investment policies are only a few problems encountered by urban infill projects.  Making it attractive to developers \r\n   The Michigan Avenue Corridor project can utilize many of the government programs, whether federal, state or local, to provide urban infill development.  In the September 2008 Corridor News the corridor itself was divided into three sections and discussion from the meeting entailed specific visions. Section areas and vision statements can be seen at the following web address <a href=\"http://www.michiganavecorridor.com/CorridorNews/tabid/66/Default.aspx.\">www.michiganavecorridor.com.</a>  Some of the visions mentioned were opportunities for small business development, creative transition/reuse, design standardization and improving the east three blocks.

There are hundreds of everyday objects and spaces that people rarely take into notice. Adding an artistic touch can change a space completely. In metropolitan areas, there are tons of opportunities for professionals or a community to put their personal touch on an area, and every new idea brings a great deal of possibilities.\r\n\r\nArt that serves a function is extremely valuable. Taking commonplace structures and objects and transforming them from something people may use and see everyday to something worth taking a moment to notice and appreciate is no easy task. Urban planners need to think outside the box when it comes to designing businesses and community-shared areas; giving people something interesting and worth living in will inspire productivity and creativity from employees, passengers, and people in general.\r\n\r\nApplying a collaborative aspect to improving the area artistically is a very useful way to bring people together in the community. Artists live to share ideas and experiences; externalizing and conceptualizing life is what artists do best.

From a simple sandbox to a stunning castle costing upwards of $90,000, a playground can act as a meeting place for children, friends, and parents.\r\n\r\n*Useful Links:*\r\n\"CityRacks Design Competition\":http://nycityracks.wordpress.com/\r\n\"The Benefits of Public Furniture\":http://www.articlealley.com/article_756888_27.html\r\n\"Play Structures for Kids by Barbara Butler\":http://www.barbarabutler.com/pricelist.php?mid=8&section=public%20use\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-30 20:07:25','2009-05-01 00:36:39',31,0,NULL,NULL),(80,'Streetscape','Adding An Artistic Touch - Collaborative','Ainsley Elder','*Collaborative*\r\n\r\n_Murals_<a href=\"http://www.cortada.com/gallery/murals/northern-ireland-mural.jpg\" border=0><img src=\"http://www.cortada.com/gallery/murals/northern-ireland-mural.jpg\" alt=\"A large, colorful mural of people.\" width=\"308\" HEIGHT=\"150\" hspace=\"10\"  align=right  /></a>\r\nMurals are a great, cost-effective way to cover a lot of real-estat e with a big impact. Typically, artists are commissioned by a sponsor, whether it be a local  government, business, or a grant. However, here in the Lansing area there are hundreds of exceptionally talented locals perfectly willing to put their artistic abilities to work. Art students from Michigan State University would benefit from the experience, being able to include it in a résumé or portfolio, local artists of Old Town can get out and practice their skills, or perhaps there would be incentive for a visiting artist to put their touch on the piece. Whether the medium is paint, tile, or another form of mosaic it has the potential to speak to and for the community at large.\r\n\r\n_Performance_\r\nArt can take nearly any form, being static, featuring audio, video, or other sensual aspects. A form of performance art gaining in popularity is “open mic” sessions where live comedy, music, readings, or poetry slams are featured in parks or other open spaces. Electronic equipment isn’t necessarily required, either – these shows are referred to as “open stage.” Performers can volunteer their time or be hired relatively cheap, as gaining publicity is a key incentive to boosting potential careers. For these types of performances to be successful, they must be well-organized, meaning timeslots are set in place and enforced. The incorporation of performances in the area will be stimulating visually, aurally, and support a sense of culture and creativity in the community.\r\n\r\n_Installations_<a href=\"\r\nhttp://www.andreacanalito.com/t3.jpg\" border=0><img src=\"\r\nhttp://www.andreacanalito.com/t3.jpg\" alt=\"Strange deer-cupcake installation art.\" width=\"340\" HEIGHT=\"220\" hspace=\"10\"  align=right  /></a>\r\nInstallation art, which is defined as art which uses three-dimensional objects to interfere with an urban environment, has received an influx of popularity over the last several years, due to works like Christo’s The Gates, where over 7,000 rectangular metal structures were placed over pathways in New York City’s Central Park. Where this installation was fairly basic, other installations include the use of light, sound, social commentary, politics, humor, and much more. Land Art is another type of installation includes arranging elements of nature into large patterns, drilling or excavating land, and utilizing various industrial technologies to alter nature. On a smaller scale, this could be a fun, interactive form of art for the Michigan Avenue Corridor.\r\n\r\n*Useful Links:*\r\n\"Community Arts and Murals Blog\":http://communityarts.blogspot.com/\r\n\"An Interesting Collection of Blogs Discussing Aspects of Street Performance\":http://en.wordpress.com/tag/street-performance/\r\n\"Land Art: Here Today, Gone Tomorrow?\":http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article.asp?id=16265\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-30 20:22:45','2009-05-01 00:36:39',31,0,NULL,NULL),(81,'Streetscape','Adding An Artistic Touch - Structural','Ainsley Elder','*Structural* \r\n\r\n_Bollards_<a href=\"http://www.uap.com.au/images/products/headers/FSH_04_A.jpg\" border=0><img src=\"http://www.uap.com.au/images/products/headers/FSH_04_A.jpg\" alt=\"Bollards.\" width=\"275\" HEIGHT=\"200\" hspace=\"10\"  align=right  /></a>\r\nBollards are a structural element featured along roads and in parking areas designed to protect property and pedestrians from vehicular collision or undesired entry. Bollards provide a clear visual cue to divide spaces and notate car-free zones. They also can serve a more utilitarian function and sport arrows or symbols to suggest directions.  Well-designed bollards may be retracted into the ground or hinged to fold over for personnel or emergency vehicles to enter an area.  Large planters are also a very easy way to improve the aesthetic of an area and add a touch of greenery. They don’t offer as much protection from danger as a security bollard, but they can mark boundaries and deter some traffic. Simple, standard bollards can begin at $70 each and ranges to more advanced designs costing thousands a piece.\r\n\r\n_Interactive Statues_<a href=\"\r\nhttp://www.uap.com.au/images/headers/birds.jpg\" border=0><img src=\"\r\nhttp://www.uap.com.au/images/headers/birds.jpg\" alt=\"Children playing with interactive statues.\" width=\"275\" HEIGHT=\"200\" hspace=\"10\"  align=right  /></a>\r\nStatues are often thought of as being motionless, dull works of art. In many public places, however, pieces of mobile or interactive art are being featured.  These types of art can either be made to move by natural elements such as wind or heat, or by the agency of a person. Some feature complex, entertaining optical illusions or are just pleasant to view. Fountains are a form of kinetic art, often spouting streams of water and droplets in gravity-defying displays and featuring fascinating lighting effects.  Encouragement of interaction with these types of art could pique the interest of the community and draw crowds, especially if a series of economical, easy-constructed and disassembled exhibits were featured in the area.\r\n\r\n_Grates, Gates, and Edgings_\r\nTrees are a common element in streetscapes and landscapes. Trees help to provide shade and to divide a dense cityscape or road from a more scenic and pleasant atmosphere. A tree grate is a flat, usually metal, with slots for watering and sidewalk drainage.  The flat grade allows for more pedestrian activity while protecting the root system of the growing tree. They are sometimes paired with a tree “guard”, which is a small gate surrounding the base of the trunk. This offers a stylish way to prevent damage from animals and forms of vandalism. Employing this type of protection for trees is a perfect opportunity to combine both function and flair.\r\n\r\n*Useful Links:*\r\n\"Rethinking Bollards: How Bollards Can Save Lives, Prevent Injuries, and Relieve Traffic\r\nCongestion in New York City\":http://www.transalt.org/files/newsroom/reports/rethinking_bollards.pdf\r\n\"Light Graffiti - A Unique Form of Performance Art\":http://weburbanist.com/2008/07/07/10-amazing-light-graffiti-artists-and-photographers/\r\n\"Street Tree Article\":http://dot.tucsonaz.gov/projects/stone/pdfs/sttree.pdf\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-30 20:34:08','2009-05-01 00:36:39',31,1,NULL,NULL),(82,'Business Development','Business Incubators','Becca Ebner','Business incubators would be a great investment for Lansing because they are designed to accelerate the successful development of entrepreneurial companies through an array of business support and resource services.

Incubators may service large-scale projects, small business development centers, or even virtual clients.

The incubator gave Martek access to specialized facilities and equipment that served as a pilot development lab for its early products. This product is now available in 60 countries worldwide and has license agreements with thirteen infant formula manufacturers, representing more than two-thirds of the world’s infant formula market. \r\n\r\nSmall business incubators tend to attract entrepreneurs who could benefit from the special assistance, which which incubator services provide during the early stages of development. Utilizing a business incubator is much more efficient – and generally more successful – than other means of pursuing entrepreneurship.

Today, this business houses well over thirty companies in specialty trade construction, applied technologies and business services, including By the Book Accounting, Go West Energy, Nova Telecommunications, and Hagan Enterprises. These businesses were successful because the William Factory provides professional mentors, management and administrative support, consulting services, referrals for loans and bonds, assistance with internet/website design, conference rooms, office and presentation equipment, and networking events.\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual clients include home-based business or early-stage companies that have their own premises but can still benefit from incubator services (for more information visit.

This is especially true for those businesses that are looking to cater to the lives of the creative class. Special subsidies are a way of showing an investment in the progress of a city. \r\n\r\nEssentially, a subsidy is a grant of money meant to assist a private person or company. Three possible subsidies that could be utilized include: one for businesses that hire new employees, one for new businesses that set up offices in the area, and one for artists who come to the city to practice their crafts. With these three forms of subsidy, a city can ensure that current businesses continue to stimulate the workforce, new businesses have a reason to establish themselves in the area, and, finally, they have something to appeal to specialized creative citizens, in the hopes of using those creative expressions to help draw in more of the creative class by appearing to be open to creativity.\r\n\r\nThis method of approach is currently being used in the city of Yokohama, Japan, where they have offered a series of subsidies for specific tech businesses and artists/creators to come to the city. A couple of these plans can be found here: <a href=http://www.city.yokohama.jp/me/keiei/kaikou/souzou/en/management/institution.html\">http://www.city.yokohama.jp/me/keiei/kaikou/souzou/en/management/institution.html</a>. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Hiring Businesses</b>\r\nOne form of subsidy that is able to be applied to businesses, both old and new, is a subsidy for those businesses that hire new employees. This form of subsidy is effective, as it extends beyond just new businesses. By opening it up for current businesses, the city can potentially keep current businesses that meet its growing needs as a creative city.\r\n\r\nAlthough the total amount for the subsidies can vary, there are multiple ways for this method to help a creative city. To help bring in the younger, creative class, the city can grant subsidies to businesses that hire fresh graduates, possibly including their training as a stipulation for the subsidy. In order to help the unemployment level of the city, the subsidy could also be extended to include the hiring and training of previously unemployed citizens. Not only would this help to employ those in need, it would also make the city more appealing, in that it would have a lower unemployment rate, which in turn would make the city seem more stable for the creative class.\r\n\r\nCurrently these types of subsidies are being used by such growing cities as Beijing, China (http://www.chinacsr.com/en/2008/11/25/3719-beijing-offers-subsidy-to-enterprises-hiring-the-unemployed/); Hamamatsu, Japan (http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/invest/region/hamamatsu-city/); and by the Canadian government (<a href=\"http://orion.ic.gc.ca/cs/ContentServer?cid=1099919425960&lang=en&pagename=CBSC_FE%2Fdisplay&c=GuideInfoGuide\">http://orion.ic.gc.ca/cs/ContentServer?cid=1099919425960&lang=en&pagename=CBSC_FE%2Fdisplay&c=GuideInfoGuide</a>). For Lansing, the biggest appeal would be for the subsidy for the employment of recent grads, as it has great potential of utilizing the students of the nearby colleges of Lansing Community College and Michigan State University.\r\n	\r\n<b>Relocating/New Businesses</b>\r\nAnother form of subsidy that can be used specifically to bring in the more innovative businesses that the corridor needs is a subsidy for new or relocating businesses. By focusing the subsidy on the specific businesses that it is looking for, the city can target only the jobs that it needs.\r\n\r\nThe extent, to which this form of subsidy may apply, depends on the types of businesses that the city wishes to draw in. A common application is to the buildings that businesses would either take over, or build themselves. The subsidy can apply to the cost to rent an office building, the costs of constructing buildings, land acquisition, or even for fees for licenses and permits. In order to be even more appealing, this form of subsidy may even be applied in addition to a subsidy for hiring and training new employees.\r\n\r\nSubsidies of this sort can be found in use in cities, such as Osaka, Japan (<a href=\"http://o-bic.net/e/setup/incentive/index.html\">http://o-bic.net/e/setup/incentive/index.html</a>, <a href=\"http://www.osakacity.org/business/subsidies.aspx\">http://www.osakacity.org/business/subsidies.aspx</a>) and New London, Connecticut (<a href=\"http://www.ci.new-london.ct.us/filestorage/27/55/2071/RentSubsidyProgramDetails.pdf\">http://www.ci.new-london.ct.us/filestorage/27/55/2071/RentSubsidyProgramDetails.pdf</a>). With regard to the Michigan Avenue corridor, this form of subsidy would help to utilize the space, both occupied and vacant. Specifically, it should make the area even more amenable when applied in concert with a subsidy on employment, which together help to establish businesses with locations and a fresh and eager workforce. \r\n\r\n<b>New Artists</b>\r\nA third form of subsidy that Lansing can use to help establish itself as a creative city is one that is relatively new in its use. As the focus of establishing a creative city has been the need to bring in more of the creative class, it stands to reason that a city can offer subsidies to specific members of that demographic. Although it is hard to specifically hand out money to a large number of individuals in the workforce, it is possible to focus on those occupations that hold appeal to the rest of the creative class.\r\n\r\nA specific occupation that is being targeted is that of artists. Although just handing money out to citizens is beyond the goal of what a city would wish, there are other ways that cities can encourage these occupations. The most common way that subsidies are being applied is found in the city of Yokohama, Japan, where the city helps with the startup costs of artists moving into existing private buildings (<a href=\"http://www.city.yokohama.jp/me/keiei/kaikou/souzou/en/project/vicinity/creator.html\">http://www.city.yokohama.jp/me/keiei/kaikou/souzou/en/project/vicinity/creator.html</a>). A possible condition of the subsidy could also be that the work of the artist be nonprofit, where the work is done for the good of the public. This work could then help to establish a cultural connection in the area, which will be further explained later in this report.\r\n\r\nAs this form of subsidy is relatively new and has not been fully tested as to its legitimacy, it does offer potential for bringing in more of the creative class. Later on, I will examine a potential public art forum, where such public art could not only help to clean up the corridor, but also give a form of entertainment. This would not only give current residents a place to explore, free of charge, but would also increase the artistic awareness of the area, thus acting as a beacon to others in the creative class.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.thenational.ae/article/20080416/REVIEW/434520556/1008&profile=1008 \">http://www.thenational.ae/article/20080416/REVIEW/434520556/1008&profile=1008</a>','http://www.michiganavecorridor.com/Portals/0/Gallery/Album/1/Picture%20078.jpg',NULL,'Michigan Avenue Corridor, Local Businesses.',NULL,'2009-03-31 15:50:52','2009-05-01 00:36:40',33,0,NULL,NULL),(86,'Streetscape','Evolving into a Connected City','James Michael Burke','<h2>Connected City</h2>\r\nAside from the economic issues associated establishing a creative city, another important feature that not only increases the appeal of a city with businesses, but also its citizens, is the establishment of what is considered a connected city. Essentially, a connected city is exactly what it sounds like. It connects its businesses and people physically, such as with public transportation, digitally, such as with high speed internet, and culturally, such as artifacts that help its citizens feel a sense of cultural significance to the area. As there are multiple methods of achieving each of these categories, this report will focus on one from each, in order to provide a range of options to help the city begin a transition in the direction of becoming connected.\r\n\r\nIn a way, one can look at becoming a connected city to be intertwined with becoming a creative city; however, just because a city is connected, doesn’t mean that it is a creative city. There is more to being deemed a creative city, than merely having a population that is connected, specifically an innovative and marketable core comprised of the creative class. It is important, on the other hand, to note that having a well connected city is a great incentive for that creative class to move in.\r\n\r\nTwo cities that are attempting to lead the way in connectivity are Birmingham, Alabama (<a href=\"http://bigcityplan.birmingham.gov.uk/connectivity.php\">http://bigcityplan.birmingham.gov.uk/connectivity.php</a>) and Sydney, Australia (<a href=http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/2030/Default.asp\">http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/2030/Default.asp)</a>. While the main focus of Sydney seems to be the transportation of the city, Birmingham has high hopes of extending itself into all three aspects of a connected city.\r\n\r\n<b>Transportation</b>\r\nFor any city, success is dependent on the quality of transportation options. Without an ease of transportation, a city is certain to fail, as its workers would have trouble reaching their jobs on the corridor and consumers would have difficulty reaching those businesses. While this necessity is nothing new, the plan of drawing more businesses to the corridor would create an influx of traffic, including those who walk, bike, and drive. One way to help alleviate the traffic would be the integration of bike lanes.\r\n\r\nWith the ever present threat of skyrocketing gas prices, even now that they have come down a bit, people are conscious of how much they drive. In order to limit their amount of driving, they are beginning to walk, bike, and take public transportation. With this in mind, people are still just as keen about getting to where they are going in a timely manner. This eagerness calls for a transportation system that is efficient. As the number of people on the sidewalks increases, the more trouble it will be for the bicyclists to traverse them. This will not only frustrate the bicyclists, but also the people on the sidewalks, who have to continually try to get out of the way. Similarly, with an increased amount of vehicular traffic, the more congested the streets will be if they get stuck behind a bicyclist. The solution, then, would be to separate the three modes of transportation. Thus we arrive at bike lanes. The bicyclists, the medium travelers, would now be able to get where they are going at their speed, without having to slow down for walkers, or without slowing down vehicles.\r\n\r\nBike lanes are no strangers to most cities. East Lansing has them set up for the Michigan State University campus, and both Vancouver (<a href=\"http://vancouver.ca/engsvcs/transport/cycling/burrard_trials.htm\">http://vancouver.ca/engsvcs/transport/cycling/burrard_trials.htm</a>) and Sydney, Australia (<a href=\"http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/2030/documents/strategy/03_TRANSPORT.pdf\">http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/2030/documents/strategy/03_TRANSPORT.pdf</a>) have begun to incorporate them. \r\n\r\n<b>Digital Infrastructure</b>\r\nThe key benefit of establishing a digital infrastructure is that it connects the people and businesses of a city with other residents, as well as the rest of the world. While the idea of a city’s population being connected and interacting is a good one, the main motivator is the global connectivity. The key way to do this is by establishing free wireless hotspots.\r\n\r\nThese hotspots are beneficial to not only the general population, but potentially businesses as well. While most businesses do set up their own digital networks, the option for a default network increases the potential for businesses to extend themselves globally. Not only does this allow the businesses to appeal to an even larger number of people, thus potentially increasing their ability to thrive, it also brings more attention to the area. For the general population, free wireless hotspots allow them to take their business and leisure out into the community, potentially enticing them to frequent the local businesses, such as coffee shops and restaurants. This freedom can further encourage the creative class to give the city a chance, and even poses the benefit of offering a place to work, other than a stuffy office or cubicle.\r\n\r\nWhile this establishment is being attempted in such cities as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (<a href=\"http://wirelessphiladelphia.org/blog_detail.cfm/blog/80\">http://wirelessphiladelphia.org/blog_detail.cfm/blog/80</a>) and Birmingham, Alabama, it is also starting to be implemented closer to home. To the west, Grand Rapids has been researching free wireless since 2004, and in 2007 began to implement the digitization of the Grand Rapids area, with the expectation of the network being finished in 2009 (<a href=\"http://www.ci.grand-rapids.mi.us/index.pl?page_id=4456\">http://www.ci.grand-rapids.mi.us/index.pl?page_id=4456</a>).\r\n\r\n<a>Cultural Connection</a>\r\nWhile transportation and free digital networks can physically/electronically connect the people of a city, an essential part of a community is a culture that is specific to an area. For New Orleans, it is jazz, Delta Blues, Mardi Gras, and a uniquely indigenous cuisine; for New York, it is financial business, theater, hip hop, and a multitude of others; even Tupelo, Mississippi has the birthplace of Elvis Presley and the Natchez Trace Parkway. If Lansing can bring out the culture of its citizens, not only will it be able to get them even more involved in the community, but it will also make itself more appealing to the creative class, who would then be able to picture themselves immersing themselves in that culture.\r\n\r\nA great way to bring out the culture of the area is to provide/set aside public spaces, or parks, for artists to display their works. If combined with the subsidy for artists, then these spaces could potentially be filled with a great variety of art pieces that not only add even more cultural value to the area, but help create places where citizens and visitors can come and just relax, while they soak up the pieces. In this way, the subsidy brings in more artists to fill these spaces for the public, which in turn makes the city more appealing to both the creative class workers and regular visitors.\r\n\r\nOne city, somewhat at the forefront of this philosophy, is Barrie, Ontario. In 1997, Barrie began what was called the ArtCity project, which has since established the city as one of Canada’s fastest growing cities, growing at about 5% per year (<a href=\"http://www.itravelsingle.com/Barrie.html\">http://www.itravelsingle.com/Barrie.html</a>). Now, Barrie is home to what is essentially a giant, free art exhibit that attracts both residents and visitors (<a href=\"http://www.creativecity.ca/resources/project-profiles/Barrie-ArtCity.html\">http://www.creativecity.ca/resources/project-profiles/Barrie-ArtCity.html</a>). Another city that is focusing its attention on its artists is Yokohama, Japan. Similar to Barrie, Yokohama is converting “historic buildings, warehouses, and other spaces,” into what is being called “Creative Core Area[s]” as part of the Creative City of Arts and Culture initiative (<a href=\"http://www.yaf.or.jp/artscommission/english.html\">http://www.yaf.or.jp/artscommission/english.html</a>).\r\n','http://www.michiganavecorridor.com/Portals/0/Gallery/Album/1/Picture%20036.jpg',NULL,'Michigan Avenue Corridor',NULL,'2009-03-31 16:05:24','2009-05-01 00:36:40',33,0,NULL,NULL),(89,'Streetscape','Celebrate Green Landscape','Musherf Alamri','Without the community support, making Lansing green would be a difficult task. One of the ways to inform the Lansing Community of city ecology importance to them , annually celebration should be held to inform people of the importance of green public spaces. One such event is PARKing Day. This is event is celebrated by transforming parking space into small green nature landscape for people site and enjoy.  The event is on Friday September 18. The main purpose of the event is to show the benefit from public places. Showing people is always more powerful than telling about how great this idea is. When people site and enjoy the small park, volunteers could inform them about the event and ways they could make this change permanent. The process of transforming parking space into green heaven is easy.\r\n!http://www.flickr.com/photos/arupaustralasia/3002140192/(people celebrating Global PARKing day)!\r\n\r\n\r\nTo put small green nature landscape a person needs the following: lawn, seating, tree, enclosure. First, plastic bollard should be linked with rope or any supporting boundary. AKA traffic tube is available for average 15 dollars. This is important for safety reasons. Then, put down your lawn with plastic under it to make the cleaning process easier. Now, put seats on the lawn. The more is the seating, place will be more attractive for passing people. Nice park benches would be great or big boxes. To provide shade, a couple of trees should put placed on the lawn. Finals, post a sign on the meter that the place is a temporal park celebrating PARKing Day.  \r\n\r\nIn the link PARKing Day original group, there is information about the event history.

From this study, green landscape could be utilized to attract people to spend more time on Michigan Avenue making it a vibrant place. Having more vegetation in Michigan Avenue should help reduce the heat in the summer. Thus, lowering the cost of the air conditioning and making it more accommodative for people to hang out in the avenue. More vegetation should diffuse some of the tension of the city hassle. Increasing Lansing vegetation should complement the effort of the current Lansing Green Initiative and receive support from the city.\r\n\r\nIn this section, three actions are suggested to assist in enhancing Lansing vegetation. First, planting more trees on the sidewalk can protect the buildings from the nature’s elements (e.g., wind and heat). Second, building gardens in empty corners and spaces should make Michigan Avenue more welcoming to children and family activities. Third, frequent community activities should coordinate to increase awareness of the benefits of greening the city.  \r\n\r\nIn the Lansing Green Initiative link, there is information about the Initiative and how people could contribute. There is also news about the efforts to make Lansing more environmental friendly. The Project for Public Space is a nonprofit organization that aims to assist people to create and sustain public spaces. In the link, there is information about projects across the world that attempt to improve public spaces. \r\n\r\n[http://www.lansingmi.gov/gogreen/ Lansing Green Initiative] \r\n[http://www.pps.org/great_public_spaces/ Project for Public Spaces]\r\n\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-31 18:00:55','2009-05-01 00:36:40',20,1,NULL,NULL),(91,'Streetscape','Planting Trees on the Sidewalk','Musherf Alamri','\r\nHarvard Business School Professor John Kotter, specializing in the dynamic of change, says that people succeed in making changes by starting with short-term visible goals. For the ultimate goal of transferring Lansing into a more ecology responsible city, planting trees on the avenue’s sidewalk should be visible to all residents. Such a short-term visible goal would be to plant 500 trees along the avenue in places which do not have a lot of trees.\r\n\r\n Native trees (e.g. American Hophornbeam) should be used to minimize the cost due to its adaptive ability to Michigan climate. The average cost of a native tree is eight dollars. Thus, for the first stage of planting, the total cost for the trees should be approximately four thousand dollars. For planting  trees, volunteers and supportive property owners with the supervision of professionals could accomplish this task. By involving the community in the process, there should be more commitment for the initiative and taking care of the trees. This will convey a message to Lansing residents that the city is working toward its objective of being greener.\r\n\r\nBecause the trees protect pedestrians from weather, more people will be interested in taking a walk along the avenue. In addition, with more trees, the pollution from cars should decrease. Crime along the avenue should decrease because there are more people watching.  Business should improve because there are more potential customers passing the front. Dan Burden, a specialist in planting urban trees, has shown that in businesses with trees their profits increase by twenty percent. \r\nIn the link 22 benefits planting tree, Dan Burden outlines the benefits of planting trees. In the link for TreePeople, an organization dedicate to improve city environment, website gives information about how to improve the city Ecology system.

Why is there only one place where you can enjoy the green nature landscape? Vacant lots and empty lands are prime places to build another community garden. By building some gardens along the avenue, the community would have an oasis in the middle of the urban area. This would be a place for people to relax from the city hustle and bustle. \r\n\r\nThis occurred in Las Parcelas, North Philadelphia, an empty parking lot which had been used by drug dealers. The community came together and turned it into the heart of the city by transforming the parking lot into a garden. Such empty places (e.g. the empty land around 222 E Michigan Avenue) could be leased and converted into a garden. The needed materials are as follows: sand, some trees, seeds, and some benches. This would be a place for people to relax or eating snack. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, an empty parking lot could become a place for the community to enjoy listening to birds singing in the morning, instead of traffic noise. For example, the empty large and underused car lot in front of Dunham’s sports shop could be converted into a small garden. This would complement the existing skateboard park and baseball field. This garden could be catered toward people with birds. This occurred in New York Lower East Side. Local community group was formed to clean up the park. The group was approached from local Chinese community with proposal to build a special garden for songbirds. The group approved of the idea. Thus, every morning people passing through Delancey Road could hear the birds singing.  The garden should have stone paths, boulders, lush perennials, and berry-producing plants that attract wild birds. To accommodate the birds’ cages, there should be 1/2-inch plumbing pipes posts planted in the group with climbing vines. Indeed, the place around Dunham’s sports shop would be a destination for skateboarders, baseball players and bird lovers. Thus, this garden would make the place an attractive destination for many people. \r\n\r\nIn the link Hua Mei Bird Garden, there is information about the bird garden in New York.

Investors can be drawn to the area in numerous ways.  They want a reasonable return for their investment and need to feel confident that there is a demand for their product.  They must believe they can complete a project on a reasonable schedule without being bogged down by policy.  \r\n  To promote investment a local jurisdiction can make certain land eligible for public improvement programs thus promoting development in the areas approved.  The cost to investors wanting to develop in areas outside the approved area (“leap-frog land”) will be much higher on the construction for the major public facilities.  Salem, Oregon is a model for this type of program.  The local government was responsible for providing off-site maintenance, replacements and upgrades, thus providing a cheaper investment for the developer and promoting urban growth.\r\n  Tax incentives can be another lure to potential investors.  A community can adopt a tax policy that discourages holding unimproved property.  Dramatic restructurings of a property tax system to tax land at a much higher rate than the rate on developed property can be beneficial.  As one example of such a program, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania taxed vacant land five times higher than land with an improved structure and it was one of the few cities in the 1980’s to report increased building activity.  Such revised tax structures and public programs can be incentives to investors towards the Michigan Avenue Corridor.   \r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-31 18:17:56','2009-05-01 00:36:40',36,0,NULL,NULL),(94,'Cooperation','Street As Room ','Musherf Alamri','\r\nIn old times, the street was not only for traffic movement. It was a place for people to gathering, a place for children to play, a place to meet new people, and so on. The street, use to make people life more enjoyable as it is the main socialization place.  These social functions have been in decline due to designing streets solely for cars. Thus, cars have invaded the community space and occupied most of street’s space. In turn, street social functions have suffered greatly due to this perception that street are only for cars. Cars have invaded the community space in Michigan Avenue. If you watch the corridor in a typical day, you would notice that most of the street is for the cars. The corridor social functions could be brought back by some modifications. The main objective of the modification is to the community perception of the corridor from a place for traffic to an outdoor room.   This should make people identify with the corridor and want to spend more time on it. In turn, the social functions of the corridor should be revived this should improve the city social life. People spending more time on the corridor, crime should decline. The suggested modifications are not fundamental. \r\n\r\nThe main difference of the street as room is that it invites people to stop and engage in some kind of activity.  Thus, to regain social function of the corridor, it must be redesigned to accommodate these activities.  This section will exam three changes that could be made to regain the functions of the street. The first change, a theme could be set up for some parts of the corridor. The second change, more trees could be planted to emitting the room feeling. \r\n\r\nThe first link connects to summary of methods David Engwicht offers to reclaim the street for the public.

The purpose of the theme would be to create fun activity to engage the community and create opportunity for people to socialize. This theme could be changed with seasonal; it does not mean it is set in stone. \r\n\r\nFor example, a theme for interval could be art for a month in the summer. An art market could be hold there for most part of the month. Local artist and galleries could be invited to display some of the material they have in storage to perspective customers. This should create a big free art gallery for the community to enjoy.  This should put people in art mood give that this part of the street is filled with art, artist. Art classes could be taught there, to encourage people to engage in artistic activity. \r\n\r\nThese classes could be provided by local studios (e.g. Sketchbook studio and Reach Studio) which already provide such services to the community and exist to service the community. These studios will be happy and support of opportunity to reach out to the community and the free publicity they will receive from participation. These classes should give the community to explore art work in their corridor and provide with opportunity to meet new people.

In ancient times, floors and streets were deemed sacred and making them look beautiful was a sacred duty. An important component of the corridor is the side walk as it is the part that pedestrians walk and stand on. Current, the Michigan Avenue has boring impersonal side walk. The sidewalk could be improved by having it having some pattern.\r\n\r\n Going with the first suggestion, the recommend pattern would some artistic drawing. For this area, a drawing of mining people, great lakes, any drawing that relates to the area history would be appropriate.  This pattern should bolster the room feeling by providing a border. Thus, the sidewalk confines the road and inducing the feeling of a room. \r\n\r\nThese drawing should give rhythm to walking. Therefore, people would be encouraged to walk which should assist people in their attempt to live a healthy life style. Because more people will be walking, this should improve business of shops on the corridor. The current impersonal sidewalk should be transferee into a meaningful sidewalk. By giving the sidewalk a sense of activity, more people should be attracting to the corridor. Therefore, the street social functions are returned.

Green space can also have many uses for the users in a city, such as hiking trails, playground equipment, and open fields to sit down and have a picnic, or play catch.

The Red Cedar Golf Course has plenty of green space for many activities, but parking can be difficult to find close to the area.  The Frandor Shopping Center has plenty of parking, but little park space to enjoy.  However, the main problem bridging these two areas is Michigan Avenue.  Crosswalks are scarce around Frandor, and at times Michigan Avenue traffic makes a safe crossing nearly impossible, especially for senior citizens and young children.  A feasible solution to the problem would be to build a pedestrian bridge connecting the two areas making Michigan Avenue easily passable for residents of all ages. \r\n\r\n      One of the biggest concerns of pedestrian bridge construction is cost.  Obviously if people could cross the street efficiently without a bridge, construction would be unnecessary.  However, the lack of crosswalks in the area along with the constantly busy traffic would make Michigan Avenue a good site for construction of a bridge.  Few parks exist on the East side of Lansing that have the size and possibility for different activities as the Red Cedar Golf Course, and while the cost of construction would be expensive (pedestrian bridges can range from $700,000 to $4,000,000), the money spent would be offset by the improvement in property values nearby, raising tax income for years to come. \r\n\r\n      In addition to connecting users to green space, the Frandor-Red Cedar Golf Course pedestrian bridge could be built using materials that would not harm the environment.  Axion International created a 100% recycled material without toxins, eliminating runoff from the bridge that could be hazardous.  In addition, the material would be less expensive and as structurally sound as other building materials.  The material has tested high in independent testing for durability, maintaining its shape for over 50 years without defects.

Eight cities in the US, Italy, Canada, and China have joined the program, including Ann Arbor, Michigan.  The promises of LED are big: up to fifty percent energy savings, product lifetimes approaching 10 years, better color rendition (meaning that colors in LED light appear more like they do in daylight), and decreased light pollution. Work completed by cities like Ann Arbor provides a chance to test the claims.\r\n\r\n<big></big>\r\nOne of the concerns many city planners have about LEDs is their high cost per lamp compared to current High Intensity Discharge (HID) lighting such as High Pressure Sodium (HPS) and Metal Halide (MH).  An HPS lamp such as those used throughout Lansing costs well under $100 per lamp, whereas LED lamps can cost several hundred dollars. Recently, the city of Anchorage, Alaska made a 2.2 million dollar investment in LED street lighting to **\"replace 16,000 lamps with LEDs\":http://betaled.com/docs/BetaLED-Anchorage.pdf** (pdf). As a result, the project costs over $137.00 per lamp.<sup>[<a name=\"fn1\" href=\"#ftn.fn1\">1</a>]</sup> A **\"2008 study\":http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/ssl/oakland_demo_brief.pdf** conducted by the Department of Energy, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, and Oakland, California showed the feasibility of replacing street lights with LEDs<sup>[<a name=\"fn2\" href=\"#ftn.fn2\">2</a>]</sup>. The study showed savings of $33-42 per lamp with LEDs with payback times of 12-26 years depending on the circumstance of construction. With continued improvements in technology, the price of each lamp is expected to decrease, reducing payback times. The high upfront costs of LEDs compared to HID lighting is a reality but comes with numerous benefits.\r\n\r\n<big></big>\r\nIncluded in these benefits are a reduction in energy consumption and an increase in public perception of safety because of improved color rendition. For example, Anchorage expects their lamps to use 50 percent less energy. In a **\"survey\":http://www.raleigh-nc.org/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_306_204_0_43/http%3B/pt03/DIG_web_content/news/public/News-PubAff-Survey_Shows_Public_Feel-20070329-105252.html** conducted by the city of Raleigh after lights in a parking garage were replaced with LEDs, 72 percent of those questioned reported feeling safe in the garage, compared to 42 percent before the lighting change<sup>[<a name=\"fn3\" href=\"#ftn.fn3\">3</a>]</sup>.  Because LED lights last longer, their use also reduces the time spent by city crews replacing bulbs.

Forests, lakes, sand dunes, and abundant wildlife make our state a beautiful location which draws visitors from around the world. The portion of Michigan Ave. between the campus of Michigan State, one of the world’s leading land-grant universities, and the Capitol provides a chance to show off the state’s natural resources. Placement of local plant species along the road and sidewalks will help beautify the Michigan Ave area, creating a friendlier environment for pedestrians and attracting customers to businesses along the street.\r\n\r\n<big></big>\r\nAround the nation cities have successfully implemented streetscape programs which provide aesthetic and environmental benefits and provide an opportunity for the public to become involved. In San Francisco, the Street Parks programs allows residents, organizations, and businesses to convert a portion of unused land into a park. In cities around the nation such as Columbia, Missouri, similar ‘Adopt-A-Spot’ programs give residences the chance to care for a portion of city landscaping. Downtown Lansing even has its own streetscape project in the form of rain gardens used to improve drainage along Michigan Ave. By expanding the rain garden project further east along Michigan Ave or by implement programs similar to those in San Francisco or Columbia, Lansing and East Lansing can provide residents with a chance for community involvement while also improving the appearance of an important thoroughfare. \r\n\r\n<big></big>\r\nStreetscapes are known to have many health benefits.  Studies conducted in the City of New York suggest that trees decrease the percentage of children who develop asthma. When properly selected, landscaping along streets can improve drainage, provide shade and a barrier from the road for pedestrians, and improve property values. Moreover, in a time in which environmental concerns are heightening, greenery placed along main roads is a way for Lansing to show that it cares about the environment. Investment in streetscape landscaping can make Michigan Ave. a greener, friendlier place to visit.\r\n\r\n<h2>Subtopics</h2>\r\n\r\n**\"-Example Projects\":http://churchsons.myvnc.com/articles/107**\r\n\r\n**\"-Benefits\":http://churchsons.myvnc.com/articles/108**\r\n\r\n**\"-Selecting Plants\":http://churchsons.myvnc.com/articles/109**\r\n\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-04-04 20:08:34','2009-04-30 22:58:34',13,1,NULL,NULL),(107,'Streetscape','Greening Michigan Ave: Example Projects','Ryan Norris ','<big><big><big><big><big>T</big></big></big></big></big>hree streetscape projects which showcase the way in which a city can improve its streetscapes are San Francisco’s Street Park program, the ‘Adopt-A-Spot’ program in existence in many cities throughout the nation, and Lansing’s rain garden program.

Giving residents and local business a chance to participate in the landscaping maintenance processes engages them in community life and saves the city money spent on caring for these spaces.  \r\n\r\n<table class=\"image styled\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5em\"\r\ncellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n<caption align=\"bottom\">This staircase was tiled by volunteers as part of a public program in San Francisco<br><small> Credit: <a href=\" http://www.flickr.com/photos/chuckbiscuito/\">Flickr User:chuckbiscuito</a></small></caption>\r\n<tr><td><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/chuckbiscuito/2503909625/in/photostream/\"><img title=\"Tiled Steps Project by Flickr User chuckbiscuito\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2200/2503909625_1aa2098ed9_o.jpg\" alt=\"This outdoor staircase in San Francisco was decorated with tiles by volunteers\" align=\"right\" width=\"200\"/></a></td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<h3><big>Street Parks</big></h3>\r\n<big><big><big>T</big></big></big>he Street Parks program in San Francisco was developed in 2004 by the Department of Public Works and the San Francisco Park Trust (SFPT). In the program, residents are encouraged to form groups or work with local organizations to develop an unused piece of public land into a small park.  Those interested in creating a garden select an available location-a sidewalk, step area, traffic circle, or median- and apply for its use. Residents can receive funding up $500.00 from the city to help with the development of the project and receive guidance on procedures and laws related to their work.

The Columbia, Missouri Adopt-A-Spot program is an example of a successful adopt a spot program in a capitol city. In this program, Columbia residents pledge to care for an already prepared spot for a year. Responsibilities of those who agree to care for a location include, weeding and watering plants in their spot. Though the city does not provide additional plants, participants do have the option of supplementing their spot with self-purchased plants.  Another city, Stow, Ohio runs an Adopt-A-Spot program which provides residents with planting materials and has them plant and care for their location throughout the year. The additional cost of these programs to a city is little and may be offset by the labor saved in maintaining the spots. A city which has already decided to devote funds to beautification can involve the community at by adopting programs like these.\r\n\r\n<h3>Links\r\n\r\n-**\"Columbia, Missouri Adopt-A-Park\":http://www.gocolumbiamo.com/Volunteer/Opportunities/Adopt-A-Spot/** \r\n\r\n-**\"Stow, Ohio Adopt-A-Spot\":http://www.stow.oh.us/Departments/Service/adopt-a-spot.shtml**\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><big>Lansing Rain Gardens</big></h3>\r\n<big><big><big>A</big></big></big>n excellent example of a streetscape project which utilizes plants for environmental and aesthetic purposes are the rain gardens which have been placed along Michigan Ave. in downtown Lansing. In this program, small gardens consisting of specially selected plants and designed soils are placed at locations where a sewer drain would normally exist alone. Prior to drainage, storm water from the street enters the garden and is purified, reducing pollution into the local water system. For a cost of about $ 1 million dollars, with help from federal funding, Lansing was able to develop gardens along four blocks<sup>[<a name=\"fn1\" href=\"#ftn.fn21\">1</a>]</sup>. To help keep the costs of maintenance down, the city implemented an ‘adopt-a-garden’ program. This successful program can be used as a guide for expansion of streetscape work further east, towards East Lansing. \r\n\r\n<h3>Links\r\n\r\n-**\"Lansing Rain Gardens\":http://www.lansingmi.gov//pubserv/cso/michigan_ave_rain_gardens.jsp** \r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\">\r\n<sup>[<a name=\"ftn.fn1\" href=\"#fn1\">1</a>]</sup>\r\n‘Taking it to the Streets’ in Water, Environment and Technology.

Trees which interfere with pedestrians or street traffic, flowers which require extensive watering, and bushes which obscure signage can make a landscaping project less effective and even dangerous. Likewise, the selection of expensive plants which are sensitive to disease or weather conditions can bring up costs, limiting the extent of a project. Working with experts in horticulture and civil engineering, city planners can create a streetscape which is both beautiful and effective.\r\n\r\n<big></big>\r\nPlants used for streetscape projects should be hardy, easy to care for, and ascetically pleasing. For example, because of problems with Emerald Ash Borers, Ash trees would be a poor choice for use in landscaping along a street.  The Lansing Parks and Recreation Department published a document called, **\"‘The Trees of Lansing’\":http://www.lansingmi.gov/Lansing/parks/forestry/docs/trees_of_lansing.pdf**(PDF) highlighting various trees used around the city, with descriptions of their physical characteristics. Such documents can be useful in considering which plants will thrive in a location. Another possibility to consider is the use of small flowering plants and bushes. Native flowers provide an attractive setting but are often easier to care for than exotic plants.\r\n\r\n<big></big>\r\nThe placement of plants is an important safety and practical consideration.  A 2005 study by Bratton and Wolf of the Transportation Research Board  showed that .7% of traffic accidents in 2002 were the result of urban trees. Though this is a small number, it is important to note any danger can be alleviated by careful consideration of the placement of large plants<sup>[<a name=\"fn1\" href=\"#ftn.fn1\">1</a>]</sup>. Moreover, while trees and plants close to the road do present a hazard which must be considered, they can also make sidewalks safer by acting as a barrier.  The benefits of using plants for streetscapes far outweigh the risks. With careful planning, Michigan Ave can be made a greener route which is friendly to cars and pedestrians alike.\r\n\r\n<big><h3>Other Useful links:</big>\r\n\r\n\r\n**\"Street Trees, Overhead Utility Distribution, and Physical Infrastructure: Design Implications, Maintenance Costs and Proposed Altneratives\":http://www.umass.edu/urbantree/mla.pdf** (PDF)-David Bloniarz of USDA Forest Service\r\n\r\n\r\nState of Massachusetts Urban and Community Forest Program Fact Sheet:**\"Right Tree in the Right Place!\":http://www.mass.gov/dcr/stewardship/forestry/urban/treeSelect.pdf** (PDF)\r\n\r\n\r\n**\"City of Livonia, Michigan Street Tree Guide\":http://www.ci.livonia.mi.us/default.asp?_resolutionfile=templatespath|default.asp&area_2=Departments/DPW/Public%20Service/Forestry/RecommendedTrees&area_3=nav/departments_dpwpublicservice**\r\n\r\n**\"Benefits & Risks of Urban Roadside Landscape: Finding a Livable Balance\":http://www.cfr.washington.edu/research.envmind/Talks/TRB_UrbnStsTrees.pdf**(PDF)\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\">\r\n<sup>[<a name=\"ftn.fn1\" href=\"#fn1\">1</a>]</sup>\r\nDixon, Karen., Wolf, Anthony.‘Benefits & Risks of Urban Roadside Landscape: Finding a Livable Balance’ presented at TRB 3rd Urban Streets Symposium</div>\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-04-05 20:11:22','2009-04-29 18:53:05',13,8,NULL,NULL),(111,'DenseMixedUse','Federal and State Urban Infill Programs','gardner','<p><font size=\"6\">T<font>here are a number of federal programs that can provide financial assistance to urban infill projects.

As a member of this group, the two topics I did research on are recycling bins and trolleys for the Michigan Avenue Corridor project. The reason I chose recycling bins was simply because I had the notion that if recycling bins for plastic, aluminum and paper were added to the street, it would help keep city environment clean, and to help citizens become more environmentally conscious. My other topic was trolleys. I did research on this and thought some new city transportation could be added, and it would start with Michigan Avenue. And like the recycling bins, it will provide a benefit for the local environment.\r\n\r\nRecycling Bins\r\nRecycling bins on the city sidewalks would be clever. In New York City for example, many of their streets have multiple recycling bins. One recycling bin is for aluminum containers. Another is for plastic containers. And, there are even bins for newspapers and magazines. If somebody is done reading a newspaper, they can recycle it instead of throwing in the garbage or on the street. City officials in New York have reported that these bins have helped decrease the littering rates in the city. IN 2006, it was reported that 1.7 million tons of recyclables were collected.\r\nThese bins are green and blue. Blue represents cans, and green represents paper. 25,000 street corners in New York City have these green and blue bins. If this idea were to be adopted for the Michigan Avenue Corridor project, it could become benefit for the Lansing area. Michigan Avenue would be the guinea pig. The bins could be placed on all of the street corners that are on the street. Once the city sees how this works, they will most likely be impressed, and decide to add them to the rest of the city corners. Lansing is not much to look at these days. However, that doesn’t mean it can’t be restored. It all starts with thinking green. Once the public becomes more environmentally conscious, the city will look cleaner and have a more positive image.\r\nAnother example of recycling bins is in the city of Toronto. They have recycling bins all over the city as well. But most of the city’s bins are located throughout parks and forestry area. Besides keeping the city clean, they try to keep their parks clean as well. This goes to show that recycling bins can also be used in many recreational areas. For Michigan Avenue, not only could the street corners have these bins, but recreational areas can have them as well. Once the city sees how the recycling bins have benefited the city streets, it will do the same thing for parks and recreational areas.\r\n\r\nTrolleys\r\nThe other topic I did research on was trolleys. In many cities such as Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Toronto, and Washington DC, there is a significant city transportation; trolleys. Trolleys are a lot like subway cars; only they run through the streets instead of underground. Now, we already have the Cata Buses as our transportation. However, trolleys can provide more benefits than a bus. One thing is for sure; they provide a more economic benefit because they run on electricity instead of gas. Like the recycling bins, Michigan Avenue can be used as a guinea pig for another experiment. If this idea were to be adapted and successful, the rest of the city could see a better future for city transportation.\r\nThere would be some issues that would occur. If this were to happen, the city would have to be careful on their spending because city dollars must be spent to add a rail system. They can become dangerous for pedestrians. If they were to be added in the street, then cyclists would not be able to use the street due to the risks of accidents. They can also be difficult to operate in mixed traffic, and could cause delayed disruptions in their lanes. One of the biggest issues that can occur is noise. The steel wheels produce a rather obnoxious noise, and it would not be a surprise to see citizens becoming displeased with the noise.\r\nDespite these issues, there are also some pros. They have much bigger capacity rate than buses. This is convenient because it will get more people to their destination on time, whereas with a bus, only so many people can fit. Since they run on batteries, they can be recharged, and this beats going to the pump because gas prices are always changing and draining money out of people’s pockets. The operating costs are also lower, and the vehicles run more efficiently. Unlike buses, trolleys give cities a more positive image than a negative image that is seen from city buses. This will help give Lansing and its community a more positive image about the city. And since they are more visible, it is easy for riders to know where routes are, so this will help people who get lost when navigating through the city. And another benefit is that they are great for passengers who are having rush hour. Instead of being stuck in a car waiting for traffic to move, all they need is 75 cents to ride the trolley, and will not have to worry about being stuck in traffic. This will prevent rush hour traffic once people start taking the trolley.\r\nI have included some sources that give more information one each topic. One is an article related to the blue and green bins in New York. The other is a website that talks about living in Toronto, and their recycling system in their city parks. The other is a government website for Scottsdale, AZ and it talks about how the city has adapted to the trolley system. Finally, my other source is the Philly Trolley website, which talks about the history of trolley cars and is provided with pictures and a historical time line.\r\n\r\nSources\r\n\r\nThese sites give more information on cities that have adapted the use of trolleys and recycling bins.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/oct2008/2008-10-27-093.asp\r\nhttp://www.toronto.ca/parks/wastediversion/media-coverage.htm\r\nhttp://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/trolley.asp\r\nhttp://www.phillytrolley.org/',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-04-14 23:59:44','2009-04-29 18:53:05',17,1,NULL,NULL),(113,'Streetscape','The Building Power of Subsidies','Mike Burke','<h3>Subsidies</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><big><big><big>I</big></big></big>n order for new businesses to want to set up in a city, there must first be some incentive for them to do so. This is especially true for those businesses that are looking to cater to the lives of the creative class. Special subsidies are a way of showing an investment in the progress of a city.</p>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"float:left; margin:5px;\">\r\n     <tr>\r\n         <td><img style=\"height:200px; width:200px;\" title=\"Riverside View\" src=\"http://churchsons.myvnc.com/system/photos/34/big/riverside_view.jpg?1241133553\" alt=\"Riverside View\"></td>\r\n     </tr>\r\n     <tr>\r\n         <td><p style=\"font-size:12px; text-align:center;\">Riverside View of Lansing Center</p></td>\r\n     </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>Essentially, a subsidy is a grant of money meant to assist a private person or company. Three possible subsidies that could be utilized include: one for businesses that hire new employees, one for new businesses that set up offices in the area, and one for artists who come to the city to practice their crafts. With these three forms of subsidy, a city can ensure that current businesses continue to stimulate the workforce, new businesses have a reason to establish themselves in the area, and, finally, they have something to appeal to specialized creative citizens, in the hopes of using those creative expressions to help draw in more of the creative class by appearing to be open to creativity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This method of approach is currently being used in the city of Yokohama, Japan, where they have offered a series of subsidies for specific tech businesses and artists/creators to come to the city. A couple of these plans can be found <a href=\"http://www.city.yokohama.jp/me/keiei/kaikou/souzou/en/management/institution.html\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Hiring Businesses</h4>\r\n<p>One form of subsidy that is able to be applied to businesses, both old and new, is a subsidy for those businesses that hire new employees. This form of subsidy is effective, as it extends beyond just new businesses. By opening it up for current businesses, the city can potentially keep current businesses that meet its growing needs as a creative city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the total amount for the subsidies can vary, there are multiple ways for this method to help a creative city. To help bring in the younger, creative class, the city can grant subsidies to businesses that hire fresh graduates, possibly including their training as a stipulation for the subsidy. In order to help the unemployment level of the city, the subsidy could also be extended to include the hiring and training of previously unemployed citizens. Not only would this help to employ those in need, it would also make the city more appealing, in that it would have a lower unemployment rate, which in turn would make the city seem more stable for the creative class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently these types of subsidies are being used by such growing cities as <a href=\"http://www.chinacsr.com/en/2008/11/25/3719-beijing-offers-subsidy-to-enterprises-hiring-the-unemployed/\">Beijing, China</a>; <a href=\"http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/invest/region/hamamatsu-city/\">Hamamatsu, Japan</a>; and by the <a href=\"http://orion.ic.gc.ca/cs/ContentServer?cid=1099919425960&lang=en&pagename=CBSC_FE%2Fdisplay&c=GuideInfoGuide\">Canadian government</a>. For Lansing, the biggest appeal would be for the subsidy for the employment of recent grads, as it has great potential of utilizing the students of the nearby colleges of Lansing Community College and Michigan State University.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Relocating/New Businesses</h4>\r\n<p>Another form of subsidy that can be used specifically to bring in the more innovative businesses that the corridor needs is a subsidy for new or relocating businesses. By focusing the subsidy on the specific businesses that it is looking for, the city can target only the jobs that it needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The extent, to which this form of subsidy may apply, depends on the types of businesses that the city wishes to draw in. A common application is to the buildings that businesses would either take over, or build themselves. The subsidy can apply to the cost to rent an office building, the costs of constructing buildings, land acquisition, or even for fees for licenses and permits. In order to be even more appealing, this form of subsidy may even be applied in addition to a subsidy for hiring and training new employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsidies of this sort can be found in use in cities, such as Osaka, Japan (<a href=\"http://o-bic.net/e/setup/incentive/index.html\">Incentives</a>, <a href=\"http://www.osakacity.org/business/subsidies.aspx\">Subsidies</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.ci.new-london.ct.us/filestorage/27/55/2071/RentSubsidyProgramDetails.pdf\">New London, Connecticut</a>. With regard to the Michigan Avenue corridor, this form of subsidy would help to utilize the space, both occupied and vacant. Specifically, it should make the area even more amenable when applied in concert with a subsidy on employment, which together help to establish businesses with locations and a fresh and eager workforce.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>New Artists</h4>\r\n<p>A third form of subsidy that Lansing can use to help establish itself as a creative city is one that is relatively new in its use. As the focus of establishing a creative city has been the need to bring in more of the creative class, it stands to reason that a city can offer subsidies to specific members of that demographic. Although it is hard to specifically hand out money to a large number of individuals in the workforce, it is possible to focus on those occupations that hold appeal to the rest of the creative class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A specific occupation that is being targeted is that of artists. Although just handing money out to citizens is beyond the goal of what a city would wish, there are other ways that cities can encourage these occupations. The most common way that subsidies are being applied is found in the city of <a href=\"http://www.city.yokohama.jp/me/keiei/kaikou/souzou/en/project/vicinity/creator.html\">Yokohama, Japan</a>, where the city helps with the startup costs of artists moving into existing private buildings. A possible condition of the subsidy could also be that the work of the artist be nonprofit, where the work is done for the good of the public. This work could then help to establish a cultural connection in the area, which will be further explained later in this report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As this form of subsidy is relatively new and has not been fully tested as to its legitimacy, it does offer potential for bringing in more of the creative class. Later on, I will examine a potential public art forum, where such public art could not only help to clean up the corridor, but also give a form of entertainment. This would not only give current residents a place to explore, free of charge, but would also increase the artistic awareness of the area, thus acting as a beacon to others in the creative class.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-04-16 06:37:34','2009-04-30 23:36:13',22,7,NULL,NULL),(114,'Streetscape','Evolving Into A Connected City','Mike Burke','<h3>Connected City</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><big><big><big>A</big></big></big>side from the economic issues associated establishing a creative city, another important feature that not only increases the appeal of a city with businesses, but also its citizens, is the establishment of what is considered a connected city. Essentially, a connected city is exactly what it sounds like. It connects its businesses and people physically, such as with public transportation, digitally, such as with high speed internet, and culturally, such as artifacts that help its citizens feel a sense of cultural significance to the area. As there are multiple methods of achieving each of these categories, this report will focus on one from each, in order to provide a range of options to help the city begin a transition in the direction of becoming connected.</p>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"float:right; margin:5px;\">\r\n<tr>\r\n         <td><img style=\"height:200px; width:200px;\" title=\"Cata Bus\" src=\"http://churchsons.myvnc.com/system/photos/87/big/number_1.jpg?1241134744\" alt=\"Cata Bus\"></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n         <td><p style=\"font-size:12px; text-align:center;\">Cata Bus Route</p></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>In a way, one can look at becoming a connected city to be intertwined with becoming a creative city; however, just because a city is connected, doesn’t mean that it is a creative city. There is more to being deemed a creative city, than merely having a population that is connected, specifically an innovative and marketable core comprised of the creative class. It is important, on the other hand, to note that having a well connected city is a great incentive for that creative class to move in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two cities that are attempting to lead the way in connectivity are <a href=\"http://bigcityplan.birmingham.gov.uk/connectivity.php\">Birmingham, Alabama</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/2030/Default.asp\">Sydney, Australia</a>. While the main focus of Sydney seems to be the transportation of the city, Birmingham has high hopes of extending itself into all three aspects of a connected city.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Transportation</h4>\r\n<p>For any city, success is dependent on the quality of transportation options. Without an ease of transportation, a city is certain to fail, as its workers would have trouble reaching their jobs on the corridor and consumers would have difficulty reaching those businesses. While this necessity is nothing new, the plan of drawing more businesses to the corridor would create an influx of traffic, including those who walk, bike, and drive. One way to help alleviate the traffic would be the integration of bike lanes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the ever present threat of skyrocketing gas prices, even now that they have come down a bit, people are conscious of how much they drive. In order to limit their amount of driving, they are beginning to walk, bike, and take public transportation. With this in mind, people are still just as keen about getting to where they are going in a timely manner. This eagerness calls for a transportation system that is efficient. As the number of people on the sidewalks increases, the more trouble it will be for the bicyclists to traverse them. This will not only frustrate the bicyclists, but also the people on the sidewalks, who have to continually try to get out of the way. Similarly, with an increased amount of vehicular traffic, the more congested the streets will be if they get stuck behind a bicyclist. The solution, then, would be to separate the three modes of transportation. Thus we arrive at bike lanes. The bicyclists, the medium travelers, would now be able to get where they are going at their speed, without having to slow down for walkers, or without slowing down vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bike lanes are no strangers to most cities. East Lansing has them set up for the Michigan State University campus, and both <a href=\"http://vancouver.ca/engsvcs/transport/cycling/burrard_trials.htm\">Vancouver</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/2030/documents/strategy/03_TRANSPORT.pdf\">Sydney, Australia</a> have begun to incorporate them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Digital Infrastructure</h4>\r\n<p>The key benefit of establishing a digital infrastructure is that it connects the people and businesses of a city with other residents, as well as the rest of the world. While the idea of a city’s population being connected and interacting is a good one, the main motivator is the global connectivity. The key way to do this is by establishing free wireless hotspots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These hotspots are beneficial to not only the general population, but potentially businesses as well. While most businesses do set up their own digital networks, the option for a default network increases the potential for businesses to extend themselves globally. Not only does this allow the businesses to appeal to an even larger number of people, thus potentially increasing their ability to thrive, it also brings more attention to the area. For the general population, free wireless hotspots allow them to take their business and leisure out into the community, potentially enticing them to frequent the local businesses, such as coffee shops and restaurants. This freedom can further encourage the creative class to give the city a chance, and even poses the benefit of offering a place to work, other than a stuffy office or cubicle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While this establishment is being attempted in such cities as <a href=\"http://wirelessphiladelphia.org/blog_detail.cfm/blog/80\">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a> and Birmingham, Alabama, it is also starting to be implemented closer to home. To the west, Grand Rapids has been researching free wireless since 2004, and in 2007 began to implement the digitization of the <a href=\"http://www.ci.grand-rapids.mi.us/index.pl?page_id=4456\">Grand Rapids</a> area, with the expectation of the network being finished in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Cultural Connection</h4>\r\n<p>While transportation and free digital networks can physically/electronically connect the people of a city, an essential part of a community is a culture that is specific to an area. For New Orleans, it is jazz, Delta Blues, Mardi Gras, and a uniquely indigenous cuisine; for New York, it is financial business, theater, hip hop, and a multitude of others; even Tupelo, Mississippi has the birthplace of Elvis Presley and the Natchez Trace Parkway. If Lansing can bring out the culture of its citizens, not only will it be able to get them even more involved in the community, but it will also make itself more appealing to the creative class, who would then be able to picture themselves immersing themselves in that culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A great way to bring out the culture of the area is to provide/set aside public spaces, or parks, for artists to display their works. If combined with the subsidy for artists, then these spaces could potentially be filled with a great variety of art pieces that not only add even more cultural value to the area, but help create places where citizens and visitors can come and just relax, while they soak up the pieces. In this way, the subsidy brings in more artists to fill these spaces for the public, which in turn makes the city more appealing to both the creative class workers and regular visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One city, somewhat at the forefront of this philosophy, is <a href=\"http://www.itravelsingle.com/Barrie.html\">Barrie, Ontario</a>. In 1997, Barrie began what was called the ArtCity project, which has since established the city as one of Canada’s fastest growing cities, growing at about 5% per year. Now, <a href=\"http://www.creativecity.ca/resources/project-profiles/Barrie-ArtCity.html\">Barrie</a> is home to what is essentially a giant, free art exhibit that attracts both residents and visitors. Another city that is focusing its attention on its artists is Yokohama, Japan. Similar to Barrie, <a href=\"http://www.yaf.or.jp/artscommission/english.html\">Yokohama, Japan</a> is converting “historic buildings, warehouses, and other spaces,” into what is being called “Creative Core Area[s]” as part of the Creative City of Arts and Culture initiative.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-04-16 06:56:11','2009-04-30 23:39:48',22,8,NULL,NULL),(115,'EnvironmentalSustainability','Planting the Seeds: A Greener Michigan Avenue','rossmanp','The Michigan Avenue Corridor has its share of beautiful views, culminating with the steps of the Capitol building.  However, areas of the Corridor, particularly those around the on-ramp to 496, would greatly benefit from the addition of trees, flowers, rain gardens, and other types of plant life.  These additions can come in the form of small “pocket parks” spaced throughout Michigan Avenue, by various trees and flowers planted along the way, and by installing rain gardens on certain areas of the Corridor to help control polluted storm runoff.\r\n\r\n!http://www.re-news.net/lansingwalks/mini-MichiganPennlookwestfromdriveway.jpg!\r\n<i>A photo of Michigan Avenue, some distance away from the Capitol.

Think about a park the size of a housing lot, and that’s the typical size of a pocket park.  These parks, although small, can have any use that one can imagine.  From a place where a worker can catch a quick bite to eat on his or her lunch break to a jungle gym where parents can take their children to play, pocket parks are a place in the middle of a city where residents can take a break from the day.  On the Michigan Corridor, pocket parks would add an urban flair to Lansing that would only enhance its beauty.\r\n\r\n!http://pics4.city-data.com/cpicv/vfiles358.jpg!\r\n<i>Michigan Avenue, close to the Capitol building.

Although parts of the Corridor around the Capitol have many trees planted, the areas farther East of the building too often have a sparse number of trees on its sidewalks. Rain gardens would not also be a welcome sight on the eyes, but also improve the environment as well.  These gardens collect rain that would usually wash pollutants into the Grand River, and allow it to filter pollutant free into the river.

The atmosphere exudes a natural comfort, but having a picnic on a golf course seems like an uncomfortable scenario.  The necessary action that must be taken in order to transform the golf course into a comfortable social space is the addition of a variety of natural aesthetics as well as the transformation of the course club house into a community center.  These natural aesthetics could include: flowers, trees, and bushes.  Also these plants must be strategically placed throughout the golf course in order to transform the property into a comfortable, natural community space.  Because the course already has such a vast area of green space, the additions of these plants would be limited and therefore would require few costs.  Similarly, the club house would need few alterations in order to transform it into a community center.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Toolbox for Community Change website, green spaces “enliven a city and build a sense of community.”1  By transforming the golf course into a community center, immediately the course transforms from a failing economic investment, into a place of community involvement.  Additionally, the strategic placement of new greenery transforms the landscape into a comfortable social space.  An example of such a transformation took place in Perrysburg, Ohio.  The Keep America Beautiful organization planted native species of flowers and added 15 trees to the Rivercrest Park property.2  The additions were all free, thanks to a donation from the Home Depot as well as the city’s flower garden.  While such an addition seems like a rather miniscule one, it still improves the comfort of the park.  Leaving a green space in neglect, results in the community neglecting the space.  With the addition of this greenery and community center, the golf course will no longer be neglected and unused. \r\n\r\nCities around the country are joining the green movement and it is becoming easier to gain access to funding for such improvements.  Visit kabtoolbox.org, which operates in conjunction with the Keep America Beautiful organization, to learn more about creating green spaces and how cities are funding this operation.

Places that are environmentally sustainable make use of natural aesthetics while creating spaces that promote social and recreational activity.  By adding basketball and volleyball courts, playgrounds, open spaces, and trails, the property would appeal to diverse interests of outdoor activity.  Also, because the location of the golf course is located between the cities of Lansing and East Lansing, the amenities must appeal to a diverse group of people that include: students, children, families, senior citizens, and all other age groups.  Therefore, having a diverse set of activities is crucial.\r\n	\r\nAccording to Fred Kent and Kathy Madden from the Project for Public Spaces website, “a park can be alive by having physical activities such as children playing or people skating, walking or jogging.”1  The importance of having green spaces that allow for various activities is that it brings diverse interests and peoples to one place where they can share an experience.  The recreational amenities listed above appeal to diverse interests of physical activity, but the implementation of these amenities can be costly.  According to produnkhoops.com, building a basketball court with the most advanced outdoor technologies could range anywhere between $9,000 and $60,000.2  Playground equipment intended for backyard use can range between $700 and $1,600.3  The prices for full scale park equipment is only available upon filing a request form, and presumably must be rather costly.\r\n	\r\nAlthough adding such recreational amenities seems costly, the investment in this green space is sustainable and will create a link between the differing communities of Lansing and East Lansing.  The diversity that this community center would promote is parallel with the interests of the Creative Class.  In order to better understand the benefits of such changes, it is necessary to look at a place that has these amenities.  The Dawson Terrace Community Center is a great example of a green space that is full of areas for physical activity including basketball courts, playgrounds, and of course the community center that has meeting rooms and other multi-purpose rooms.

The green landscape is already conducive to such activity because it is secluded from the hustle and bustle of the city.  By simply adding park benches and picnic areas, the golf course property will become a space that promotes a social atmosphere.  While it is important for parks to have a variety of physical activities, it is equally important to have areas of social activity because this appeals to other groups of people.  \r\n\r\nAccording to Fred Kent and Kathy Madden from the Project for Public Spaces website, “many of todays urban parks have few activities outside of recreational opportunities, and do not attract people such as seniors or teens, or people who are just looking for a place to sit.”1  With this in mind, adding park benches and picnic areas gives an outlet to these people that wish to enjoy nature in a more intimate way.  By having sitting areas around the park along with recreational amenities, the park becomes more multi-faceted and gives more reasons for people to visit this community center.  Of course adding such amenities result in costs.  Park benches that vary in style and color also vary in price ranging from $200 to $1,700 each.2  Picnic tables also with varying styles and colors range in price from $400 to $1,500 each.3  While these prices are from only one company, the prices give a good idea of what could be expected when purchasing such equipment.\r\n	\r\nAdding amenities such as benches and picnic tables do entail some costs, but those costs are much less than the losses that the golf course has had in the past few years.  As simple as this addition seems, the benefits are great.  The course would become a community center that would be beneficial to social activity and would create an atmosphere that would be visited again and again.  For instance, according to centralparknyc.org, Central Park has “over 9,000 benches which would stretch 7 miles if placed end to end.”4  Central Park is a wonderful example of a place that has created a positive social atmosphere that is visited again and again.

The Ingham Conservation District (ICD) coordinated a more than $50,000 project to improve and create a buffer space along the Red Cedar between Lansing and East Lansing.2  Buffer spaces are vegetation areas along a body of water that helps filter and collect the urban runoff which can include pollutants.  The ICD worked with MSU, the Lansing Board of Water and Light and the City of Lansing and created about “500 feet of urban buffers.”2  With this environmental consciousness being expressed by our city leaders, a more individual awareness must follow.\r\n\r\nIn order to fight the Red Cedar’s reputation of pollution, students in the MSU Water group are taking action in improving this reputation as well as ensuring a clean and healthy future for the river.  The MSU Water group’s website not only discusses what they are attempting to do in order to improve the cleanliness of the river, but also what individuals can do.3  It is not necessary that we pay money to recycling companies or environmental cleaning agencies in order to improve this landmark whose name is heard in the MSU fight song.  What is necessary is action by all Lansing and East Lansing people.  The river can be clean as long as we take the proper action.  There needs to be concern and care in regards to the health of the Red Cedar because it has been an attraction not only to MSU students but also residents of Lansing and East Lansing.\r\n	\r\nTaking it upon ourselves as residents to clean and keep clean the Red Cedar has obvious benefits.  Not only would this river be aesthetically pleasing, but also could attract even more use.  Having a landmark that is clean would portray a positive image on the cities of Lansing and East Lansing and therefore would result in the use and reuse of this area.  Activities such as swimming would no longer be frowned upon because of the river’s reputation and therefore would create a whole new image and social atmosphere to not only MSU but also Lansing.  This would attract all demographics of people and promote the diversity that the Creative Class so longs for.  Most importantly, it costs nothing to simply be aware and help keep this river clean.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n\r\n1.

Yet when one crosses Harrison and begins down the trail going towards Lansing it seems the atmosphere becomes more limited in a social sense.  The portion of the Red Cedar trail between Lansing and East Lansing that begins at Harrison Road and ends at Elm Street is a 2-mile stretch of trail that is relatively inactive compared to the portion of the trail through MSU and through the heart of Lansing.  The portion of the trail that runs past the capitol building is filled with social landmarks just as the portion that runs through MSU has areas for diverse activities.  To make this more visible visit the following link to get a map view of the river along with the landmarks that run along it.1\r\n	\r\nSimply adding a series of park benches, and perhaps picnic tables would create yet another social aspect to the Red Cedar.  While the trail is always busy with foot and bike traffic, the portion mentioned above has very few amenities that would promote the use on a more stationary level.  What this means is that there are not enough places for people to gather or meet that not only gives a good view of the river and its natural beauties, but is also distanced enough from the trail to ensure safety and privacy.  For instance, the Lake Erie Metropark in Brownstown, Michigan has a great amount of park benches that are placed strategically throughout the park.  Some benches are even hidden to the naked eye and therefore ensure a bit of privacy which promotes a more intimate relationship with the surrounding area.2  \r\n	\r\nOf course adding benches would not only cost money for the benches themselves, but also for the assembly of the benches.  Fortunately, the portion of the trail that runs through MSU and the portion that runs through downtown is surrounded by many places of interest.  It is the 2-mile portion mentioned above that must first be addressed.  The reason this is fortunate is because it is a smaller area which makes it more economically attainable.  An example where a similar project was done was in Round Rock, Texas.  There they added playground equipment, park benches, picnic tables, and sidewalks and worked with a $55,000 budget.  When the Red Cedar River’s focus is just benches and tables, the cost can be assumed to be much less than that especially because of the brief two mile distance.3  The benefits of having more social spots along the Red Cedar are clear: visitors and residents will be attracted to these areas, the river will become a social landmark not only in Lansing and East Lansing but also along the corridor, and the investment is relatively small with little maintenance required.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n\r\n1.

It is one thing to know something exists and it is another to know where it exists.  The Red Cedar River trail has many points of access in the parts that are found on the Campus of MSU.  There are two trails total, one on each side of the river, and therefore many access points are available to the citizens.  Similarly the map of the Lansing River Trail shows a series of places where one could park in Lansing and have access to the trail. 1  It seems necessary that the river trail must not only be advertised more, but also information is needed in order to understand distances and navigation issues when traveling along the trail.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a simple solution that would increase trail use by MSU students as well as Lansing citizens and that is signage.  Strategically placing signs along the river at points where not only foot and bike traffic are highest, but also car traffic, would advertise the river’s trail much more.(Example of sign in Crystal Falls Michigan http://hunts-upguide.com/photos/375.gif)  Also, these signs would have information that would be important to the people who are using the trail because it would answer navigation and distance questions.  The Red Cedar River Buffer project has begun confronting this idea of accessibility to the river.  They have created 4 new river access points and also have placed signs where they created buffer spaces that tell why the buffers are important.2  While these signs do not help with navigation of the trail, they help advertise the trail and therefore make it more accessible.\r\n	\r\nSigns are a simple solution to the dilemma of accessibility to the Red Cedar River.  For instance, in Chicago there are signs that say “Chicago Riverwalk” and by simply walking down the stairs that the sign hangs over, people are able to easily know what they are doing and where they are going to.  (image of sign in Chicago http://chicagoarchitecturetoday.com/Images/Riverwalk%20signs.jpg)  The Red Cedar River has a sufficient amount of access points along the river, but the knowledge of these areas must be improved by the use of signage.  The river is accessible and connects people to many other landmarks in East Lansing and Lansing, but making information about the river more visible will promote its use and make the river more accessible.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n\r\n1.

You might also see a street barren of plant life.  The city of Lansing has done well in increasing the number of plants close to the Capitol building.  However, areas along Michigan Avenue, especially those around the 496 overpass, would greatly benefit from tree planting.  The positives from planting trees on city streets are not just aesthetic, but financial and environmental as well.\r\n\r\n<b>What Trees Can Do on Michigan Avenue</b>\r\n\r\nTrees can be planted just about anywhere along a city street or median, just as long as they don’t block important streetlights or obscure traffic.  Once planted, trees provide shade on a street, which cools pedestrians on hot summer days.  Trees also have the benefit of reducing storm runoff.  A study by the United States Forest Service showed that trees reduced storm runoff by as much as eight percent in Chicago.  Besides those environmental benefits, streets lined with trees have a higher property values compared to streets without trees.  Lastly, a tree-lined view from a window might be beneficial to children; researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have shown that views of trees through a window reduce attention deficit disorder symptoms.\r\n\r\n<b>Factoring in Costs</b>\r\n\r\nTrees help a city in many ways, but they are not without their costs.  Planting trees may be difficult in a cold area such as Lansing, since salt used to deice roads can wash into the tree’s soil.  If enough salt is deposited into the tree’s soil, it will die.  Because of this, trees cannot be planted at street level in Lansing, since salt could easily enter the soil.  In addition, every fall, tree leaves would have to be collected by the city, since tree leaves contain phosphorous, an element that can be harmful to the environment in large quantities.  Care must also be taken in spacing the trees.  If the trees are too close together, the leaves will not collect enough sunlight to grow.  With the proper attention, trees can be planted throughout the Michigan Avenue Corridor to create a green pathway linking Lansing and East Lansing.\r\n\r\n\"Protecting Our Waters - Street Trees\":http://clean-water.uwex.edu/plan/streetrees.htm - An explanation of the benefits trees provide cities.\r\n\r\n\"22 Benefits of Urban Trees\":http://www.ufei.org/files/pubs/22BenefitsofUrbanStreetTrees.pdf - A pdf file listing 22 reasons trees improve urban areas (Requires Adobe Acrobat Reader).\r\n\r\n\"University of Arizona "Street Trees" Pull Double Duty\":http://uanews.org/node/22150 - A press release touting how trees have improved the University of Arizona’s campus.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-04-16 20:09:53','2009-04-29 18:53:06',8,4,NULL,NULL),(127,'Environmental Sustainability','Bridging the Red Cedar Golf Course and Frandor: Pedestrian Bridges','rossmanp','Right next to each other, the old Red Cedar Golf Course and Frandor Shopping Center each has something desirable.  The Red Cedar Golf Course has plenty of green space for many activities, but parking can be difficult to find close to the area.  The Frandor Shopping Center has plenty of parking, but little park space to enjoy.  However, the main problem bridging these two areas is Michigan Avenue.  Crosswalks are scarce around Frandor, and at times Michigan Avenue traffic makes a safe crossing nearly impossible, especially for senior citizens and young children.  A feasible solution to the problem would be to build a pedestrian bridge connecting the two areas making Michigan Avenue easily passable for residents of all ages.\r\n\r\n<b>A Good Investment</b>\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest concerns of pedestrian bridge construction is cost.  Obviously if people could cross the street efficiently without a bridge, construction would be unnecessary.  However, the lack of crosswalks in the area along with the constantly busy traffic would make Michigan Avenue a good site for construction of a bridge.  Few parks exist on the East side of Lansing that have the size and possibility for different activities as the Red Cedar Golf Course, and while the cost of construction would be expensive (pedestrian bridges can range from $700,000 to $4,000,000), the money spent would be offset by the improvement in property values nearby, raising tax income for years to come.\r\n\r\n<b>Environmentally Helpful</b>\r\n\r\nIn addition to connecting users to green space, the Frandor-Red Cedar Golf Course pedestrian bridge could be built using materials that would not harm the environment.  Axion International created a 100% recycled material without toxins, eliminating runoff from the bridge that could be hazardous.  In addition, the material would be less expensive and as structurally sound as other building materials.  The material has tested high in independent testing for durability, maintaining its shape for over 50 years without defects.  In constructing an environmentally friendly bridge, the City of Lansing can help its residents enjoy nature while preserving it.\r\n\r\n<b>Links</b>	\r\n\r\n\"Pedestrian Overpasses/Underpasses\":http://www.walkinginfo.org/engineering/crossings-overpasses.cfm - An article explaining the basics of pedestrian bridge construction.\r\n\r\n\"Power of the Pedestrian Bridge\":http://www.gobridges.com/article.asp?id=1627 – Details how pedestrian bridges have added style and distinctiveness to cities.\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-04-16 20:18:01','2009-04-29 18:53:06',8,3,NULL,NULL),(128,'Environmental Sustainability','Green Spaces Mean Better Places','rossmanp','The question you might be asking yourself is, “What is green space?”  Well, for the broadest definition of the term, green space is a place within an urban area devoted to nature, and is protected by the city.  Green space can be undeveloped, such as an area of wetlands.  Green space can also have many uses for the users in a city, such as hiking trails, playground equipment, and open fields to sit down and have a picnic, or play catch.  Along the Michigan Avenue Corridor, many opportunities exist to develop unused parking lots into green areas for the benefit of Lansing and East Lansing, particularly in the Frandor Shopping area.\r\n\r\n<b>Green Spaces Foster Community while Increasing its Value</b>\r\n\r\nThere are many pluses to having green space in a city.  One of the greatest benefits is that green spaces create a beautiful community, which attracts people to move there, according to a study by psychologist Rachel Kaplan.  Another benefit is that green spaces have been shown to increase property values.  In a 2006 study, the Trust for Public Land in Washington County, Minnesota showed that houses that were next to green space had their property values increased by $15,000 per home.  Finally, a study by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has shown that “Green spaces are gathering places that create close-knit communities and improve well-being – and in doing so, they increase safety.” \r\n\r\n<b>Possibilities for Green Space along Michigan Avenue</b>\r\n\r\nMany places in Lansing would benefit from the addition of green space, but perhaps no area would gain more than the Frandor Shopping Center.  Many parking lots in the center are filled to only a fraction of their capacities most of the time.  Those parking lots could be converted to green spaces where the residents of Lansing and East Lansing could enjoy walks and picnics, all while being easily accessible from Michigan Avenue.  The costs associated with the installation of green space would be offset by the environmental benefits of containing poisonous storm runoff, and the increase in property values.  Above all, adding green space to Lansing would give the residents a place to relax, relieve stress, and enjoy life.\r\n\r\n<b>Links</b>\r\n\r\n\"Parks and Recreation in Lansing\":http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Midwest/Lansing-Recreation.html - This website is a resource to visitors to the Lansing area looking for green space.\r\n\r\n\"How Green Spaces Benefit Lifestyles\":http://www.projectevergreen.com/whygreenmatters/lifestyle.html - This links to a list of several benefits green spaces provide a community’s residents.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-04-16 20:23:37','2009-04-29 18:53:06',8,0,NULL,NULL),(129,'Environmental Sustainability','Planting the Seeds: A Greener Michigan Avenue','rossmanp','The Michigan Avenue Corridor has its share of beautiful views, culminating with the steps of the Capitol building.

These additions can come in the form of small “pocket parks” spaced throughout Michigan Avenue, by various trees and flowers planted along the way, and by installing rain gardens on certain areas of the Corridor to help control polluted storm runoff.\r\n\r\n!http://www.re-news.net/lansingwalks/mini-MichiganPennlookwestfromdriveway.jpg!\r\n<i>A photo of Michigan Avenue, some distance away from the Capitol.

Think about a park the size of a housing lot, and that’s the typical size of a pocket park.  These parks, although small, can have any use that one can imagine.  From a place where a worker can catch a quick bite to eat on his or her lunch break to a jungle gym where parents can take their children to play, pocket parks are a place in the middle of a city where residents can take a break from the day.  On the Michigan Corridor, pocket parks would add an urban flair to Lansing that would only enhance its beauty.\r\n\r\n!http://pics4.city-data.com/cpicv/vfiles358.jpg!\r\n<i>Michigan Avenue, close to the Capitol building.

Although parts of the Corridor around the Capitol have many trees planted, the areas farther East of the building too often have a sparse number of trees on its sidewalks. Rain gardens would not also be a welcome sight on the eyes, but also improve the environment as well.  These gardens collect rain that would usually wash pollutants into the Grand River, and allow it to filter pollutant free into the river.  By tweaking Michigan Avenue to allow more plant life and green space, the Corridor can welcome visitors throughout its length, and not just at the Capitol.\r\n\r\n<b>Links</b>\r\n\r\n\"Greater Lansing "Go Green!"

In a city, however, pavement and concrete prevents water from soaking into the ground, and the water often picks up pollutants such as pesticides, insecticides, and harmful compounds left behind by automobiles.  This polluted water is called storm runoff, and if left unchecked, can be harmful to animals and eventually people.  Storm runoff can collect many types of compounds.  Sediment in runoff can cloud water, preventing the proper growth of aqueous plants.  Storm runoff can also contain trash such as plastic bags and six-pack rings which can suffocate fish, birds, and other animals, and bacteria which can make others sick.  \r\n\r\n<b>How Lansing is Combating Runoff</b>\r\n\r\nLansing has made a huge investment in its sewers and storm drains to limit the harmful effects of both untreated sewage and storm runoff.  Beginning in 1991, the city began a 30-year project to create an additional sewer.  The new sewer would collect all the sewage, and the old sewer would collect the storm runoff, limiting the amount of hazardous waste dumped into the Red Cedar and Grand Rivers after a rainstorm or snow melt.  When this project is completed, Lansing expects to eliminate 1.65 billion gallons of combined sewage overflow (both human wastes and storm runoff) per year.  As an added benefit of the project, repairs can be made to existing water mains, gas pipes, and other pieces of infrastructure that might not be normally be reachable, allowing the city to replace and improve those pipes, making them more efficient than what they are currently.\r\n\r\n<b>How You Can Prevent Runoff</b>\r\n\r\nAction can also be taken by the individual to stop storm runoff.  Dont pour used motor oil down the drain, as storm water will eventually wash the used oil into the ground water, polluting it.  Limit the use of pesticides and fertilizers when gardening or working on the lawn.  Place a mosquito-proof rain barrel underneath the rain gutter to collect rain water, then use that water to water your lawn or garden.  When walking the dog, make sure to pick up any waste it leaves behind, as rain water can pick up bacteria in that waste and deposit it in drinking water sources.  These steps may seem like a lot to remember, but by taking a few common sense steps, we can preserve the water quality of the Lansing area for generations to come.\r\n\r\n<b>Links</b>\r\n\r\n\"After the Storm\":http://www.epa.gov/weatherchannel/stormwater.html – The Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) website detailing the dangers of storm runoff.\r\n\r\n\"What is CSO?\":http://www.cityoflansingmi.com/pubserv/cso/the_cso_story.jsp - The City of Lansings website on its sewer construction project.\r\n\r\n\"Reduce Stormwater Runoff\":http://www.clemson.edu/extension/natural_resources/water/carolina_yards/principle_7.html – Instructions on how to construct your own rain barrel, preventing storm runoff and its related pollution.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-04-16 20:31:48','2009-04-29 18:53:06',8,5,NULL,NULL),(131,'Environmental Sustainability','The Green Space Next Door – Pocket Parks','rossmanp','What are pocket parks?  Pocket parks are defined as small spaces (usually smaller than 1000 square feet, or the size of a quarter-acre) within urban areas.  These parks can have many uses, from a  place of benches and tables were people can enjoy a coffee and a newspaper, to swing sets and sandboxes, creating an area where children can play.   Michigan Avenue has many lots around its corridor which currently hold barely filled parking lots or empty storefronts.  With proper planning and the right group of volunteers, pocket parks can be installed in those areas, creating a park-filled Michigan Avenue Corridor.\r\n\r\n<b>What Makes a Good Pocket Park?</b>\r\n\r\nA pocket parks success is tied to a few select traits.  One of the most obvious traits to consider in installing a pocket park is its location.  Most successful pocket parks are placed in areas of high pedestrian traffic, as to maximize their visibility and use.  For the greatest benefit to the corridor, the parks should be situated on Michigan Avenue to be visible to the greatest amount of traffic.  Another factor involved in planning a pocket park is the needs of its users.  Good pocket parks will be able to accommodate several different uses (for example, playground equipment for children and tables for workers wanting a quick bite to eat on their lunch hours) without being cluttered.  Lastly, the frequency of pocket parks in a given area is a critical trait; too many parks and the space will go unused, while too few parks will cause the park to be overcrowded.\r\n\r\n<b>Building Pocket Parks in Lansing</b>\r\n\r\nThe construction of pocket parks in Lansing will be tied to the previous characteristics.  To construct these parks, many different groups will have be partners in their construction and maintenance.  In pocket park construction, a neighborhood group organizes and typically assumes the task of maintaining the park.  The City of Lansing could also assume some of the burden as well, along with businesses near the park and civic groups, such as the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.  These groups would perform the lawn mowing, weeding, sweeping, and other duties necessary to keep the park clean.  With a little bit of work and cooperation, about any place can be converted into a pocket park, which can be a center for enjoyment.\r\n\r\n<b>Links</b>\r\n\r\n\"Pocket Parks - The Basics\":http://depts.washington.edu/open2100/pdf/2_OpenSpaceTypes/Open_Space_Types/pocket_parks.pdf – A document published about the basics of pocket parks (requires Adobe Acrobat Reader).\r\n\r\n\"MPR Pocket Park\":http://minnesota.publicradio.org/about/mpr/park/ - A website detailing the creation and blueprints of a pocket park in Minnesota, highlighting how a pocket park is developed.\r\n\r\n\"Cooley Gardens Website\":http://www.cooleygardens.org/ - Website of Cooley Gardens, a 1 acre pocket park in Lansing.

These gardens not only serve to make Lansing beautiful, they prevent rain water from collecting pollutants that would otherwise reach the Grand River.  This project cost the city $1 million dollars, or $122 per square foot to complete.  The construction of a rain garden is not as simple as cutting a hole through a sidewalk and planting flowers.  A rain gardens soil must use specific materials to allow roots to take hold in the garden and filter storm runoff.\r\n\r\n<b>How Rain Gardens Work</b>\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of each Lansing rain garden is a drain.  This drain allows water to flow into the Grand River from the garden.  On top of the drain is a layer of pebbles, and on top of the pebbles is a special blanket to keep the soil from going down the drain.  The soil is a special blend of many different materials, engineered to hold roots and allow water to flow to the drain.  The soil is 30% sand, 30% topsoil (which consists of 10% sand, 40% silt, 40% clay, and 10% organic matter), 30% compost that has been aged for one year, and 10% coif, or coconut fiber.  For the final layer, two inches of mulch are placed on top of the soil.  Plants were chosen for the gardens based on their ability to tolerate salt, drought, and flooding; their height, and their attractiveness.  Now that the gardens were built, they had to be maintained.\r\n\r\n<b>How Rain Gardens are Maintained</b>\r\n\r\nThe City of Lansing was looking for ways to reduce maintenance costs associated with the rain gardens. One idea was to create an adopt-a-garden program.  Businesses or groups participating in the program would be in charge of removing litter and weeds at the garden, and in exchange for the gardens maintenance, a small sign would be placed at the garden to mark that business or groups contribution.  The other idea was that Lansing implemented a special work day in the Spring were volunteers were instructed by city workers how to maintain the gardens.  The volunteers were able to recognize which plants were weeds and which plants were useful by using an identification card with pictures.  With the help of neighborhood groups, local businesses, and the City of Lansing, the rain gardens have been successful at both keeping the Grand River clean and beautifying downtown Lansing.\r\n\r\n<b>Links</b>\r\n\r\n\"Taking it to the Streets\":http://www.tetratech.com/StaticFile/PDFs/PapersArticles/Taking_It_To_The_Streets.pdf – An article that details how rain gardens were constructed in Lansing (Requires Adobe Acrobat Reader).\r\n\r\n\"Rain Gardens - A How-to Manual for Homeowners\":http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/water/wm/dsfm/shore/documents/rgmanual.pdf – A manual that instructs  homeowners how to install a rain garden on their properties.\r\n\r\n\"Rain Garden Network\":http://www.raingardennetwork.com/ - A website with many different resources on rain garden construction, planting, and maintenance.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-04-16 20:41:09','2009-04-29 18:53:06',8,5,NULL,NULL),(133,'EnvironmentalSustainability','From Gray to Green: Redeveloping Frandor Sustainably','rossmanp','The 497,000 square feet that compose the Frandor Shopping Center on Michigan Avenue, just east of 496, has seen many stores come and go in its time.

Pocket parks are small areas of land, usually no bigger than the side of a few house lots, in which residents can read, work, or enjoy a coffee.  Green spaces would be a nice substitution for areas of parking lot that are no longer used or stores that have been long vacant.  Another improvement to the Frandor area would be a walkway over Michigan avenue from Frandor to the Red Cedar Golf Course.  The parking lots in Frandor would make an excellent point to access the course if a walkway was built over the typically busy Michigan Avenue.  The addition of a walkway would create value in both Frandor and create greater opportunities for use for the Red Cedar Golf Course.\r\n\r\n<center>!http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3645/3447802799_6c88335e54.jpg?v=0!</center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>One of a few business to close in Frandor in the recent past. \r\n(Credit: http://www.midmichigandining.com)</i></center>\r\n\r\n<b>Reducing Pollution in Lansing</b>\r\n\r\nAnother benefit from redeveloping Frandor will be the reduction of often-polluted storm runoff from the area.  Since the Frandor area is mostly paved, rain water will pick up pollutants from cars in Frandors parking lots.  This rain water carries these pollutants through the Montgomery drain into the Red Cedar River.  By adding more green space and  reducing the area of parking lots in Frandor, the area can be beautified with the added benefit of cleaning up the Red Cedar River as well.\r\n\r\n<b>Links</b> \r\n\r\n\"Frandor Planning\":http://www.lansingmi.gov/Lansing/pnd/planning/2008_06_26_summary.pdf – A summary of planned changes to the Frandor area.\r\n\r\n\"Massive Environmental Redesign Planned for Frandor Area\":http://www.lansingcitypulse.com/lansing/print-article-1115-print.html – An article from the City Pulse that details the possibilities of Frandors redevelopment.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-04-16 20:51:10','2009-04-29 18:53:06',8,0,NULL,NULL),(134,'Environmental Sustainability','From Gray to Green: Redeveloping Frandor Sustainably','rossmanp','The 497,000 square feet that compose the Frandor Shopping Center on Michigan Avenue, just east of 496, has seen many stores come and go in its time.

One of the most important things to consider when rethinking a space is the audience youre designing for - many college students and older citizens either do not have access to a car or opt not to keep one because of the cost of parking. \r\n<br>One of the greatest things a bike lane could potentially do is encourage folks in the area to move closer to the city, as they will feel connected to a community, and would no longer have to spend valuable money and time driving their vehicle to access a city experience. A bike lane, coupled with available bike rack parking outside of businesses or near parking lots could also reduce congestion and traffic in the area.\r\n<br>One of the more successful areas where bike lanes have been implemented is the Chicagoland area, most notably the Wicker Park area.

Folks will feel more comfortable in the area if theyve got their valuables behind lock and key to be retrieved later - this could also prove very useful for out-of-town travelers or people out to see the nightlife the Lansing area has to offer. These lockers could be installed in a central location, or perhaps even at major bus stops or train stations. \r\n<br>One instance where this system is implemented successfully is in Novi, MI at Twelve Oaks Mall, where 200 lockers are available at .50 cents per use for customers to store their valuables: http://www.shoptwelveoaks.com/infodesk/FAQ.html#137\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-04-16 23:20:04','2009-04-29 18:53:06',16,2,NULL,NULL),(138,'Transportation','Sprucing Up Michigan Avenue','justinW','<b>Increased greenery</b> all along the corridor would serve as a means of bridging the \"imaginary gap\" between the cities of East Lansing and Lansing.

Such an area is characteristically rooted in community activity and interaction. In order to transform the Michigan Avenue Corridor into a more creative and interactive neighborhood, measures to increase pedestrian movement and local interest are needed. Increasing pedestrian traffic and transportation in terms of closeness and relation to relevant businesses, known as walkability, combined with navigation based on efficiency and modernization are ways of working toward urban renewal.\r\nA few ways the Michigan Avenue Corridor could be enriched to offer extended walkability and better navigation would be to repair and extend sidewalks, curbs and crosswalks, use symbols and landmarks to distinguish certain areas and locations and to provide digital interactive map kiosks. These steps would serve to encourage pedestrians to go out and about, as well as help them easily get to their destinations.\r\n“www.maine.gov”:http://www.maine.gov links to a document based on “expanding and enhancing modes of transportation. The information in the link describes the importance of appropriately sized sidewalk and crosswalk areas based on safety as well as easy navigation. The following YouTube video, shows direct interaction between a pedestrian and an interactive map kiosk.\r\nSidewalks, curbs and crosswalks should be extended or repaired in necessary areas within the Michigan Avenue Corridor in order to better fit the needs of the people that utilize them on a daily basis. Sidewalk repair usually falls on the shoulders of the businesses that own the property adjacent to the sidewalks. Increased pedestrian activity would be an incentive for local businesses to repair these areas. Partial city funding and an encouraging incentive campaign could aid in the process.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/37711425@N02/3479458284/\" title=\"DSC00569 by chenow10, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3565/3479458284_b0f44a840e.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"DSC00569\" /></a>\r\nRepair and extension is important because well-paved and easily accessible walking space is vital to enhancing and enabling a walker or biker’s experience. “Walkable and attractive environments” play a crucial role in the appeal of a creative city. Appropriately spaced sidewalks reduce crowdedness on busy streets and offer a freer range of mobility and movement for pedestrians. Also, accurately labeled signs on crosswalks, corners or sidewalks would help direct pedestrians to their intended destinations.\r\nCharacteristically, creative cities and functional urban atmospheres use sidewalk space and crosswalks for various reasons. Commercial areas often require sidewalks on both sides of the street so that pedestrians can easily access businesses. In these areas, extra space needs to be accounted for to accommodate “window-shopping”. However, adequate sidewalk spacing is important in terms of efficiency and pace as well. It is essential that pedestrians on a casual afternoon stroll do not impede those using the sidewalks as a means to get to work or those jogging or running. Overall, sidewalks and crosswalks should be constructed, extended or repaired in order to put up with all the needs pedestrians in a creative city will have.\r\nTo find out more about appropriate use of sidewalks and crosswalks, please visit “www.maine.gov”:http://www.maine.gov. For insight on how these spaces have been altered to enhance the pedestrian experience in other cities, please see “www.ci.nyc.ny.us”:http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us.\r\nThe use of symbols and landmarks to aid in navigation is a practice that goes back to the very beginnings of human transportation. Various forms of architecture, statues or decorations could be constructed and used in order to differentiate between individual areas within the corridor. These additions would serve to make certain locations more recognizable or familiar to pedestrians and to assist them in acclimating to and understanding their surroundings promptly.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/37711425@N02/3478647597/\" title=\"DSC00564 by chenow10, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3551/3478647597_1662563c87.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"DSC00564\" /></a>\r\nIn many cities, landmarks are located in numerous areas and can be used to help a pedestrian situate him or herself. For instance, on Michigan State University’s Campus right here in Lansing, the Sparty Statue can be used to pinpoint one’s location in relation to Spartan Stadium, the Library, or position on campus in general. As well as providing aesthetic appeal for pedestrians, landmarks like Sparty serve as navigational tools.\r\nIn Canton, Michigan symbolic artwork and statues have been placed in front of various businesses and along streets and corners. Though aesthetic and artistic appeal are definitely present here, the use of these pieces can be helpful in finding entrances to parking lots or businesses as well as specific streets. Similar approaches could be taken within the Corridor, especially in the areas attractive to pedestrians such as Ranney Skatepark.\r\nFor more information on the use of road art in Canton MI please visit “www.canton-mi.org”:http://www.canton-mi.org/arts/fordroad_art.aspx.\r\nDigital interactive map kiosks could be positioned in various points throughout the corridor in order to equip pedestrians with the necessary knowledge to navigate from place to place. Whether an individual is searching for a business, a street corner or a bus stop, the interactive map kiosk would serve to link them to a computer navigation system that can basically give any information about the area that would be relevant or necessary. Locations, addresses and directions to surrounding restaurants, gas stations, ATM’s, etc. would be at a pedestrian’s fingertips instantly.\r\nBy far the most expensive option for increasing the navigation within the corridor would be the implementation of the kiosk system. These digital interactive map kiosks are very common in China. They are built on a database of information and are designed to locate services, find phone numbers, names and provide detailed mapping of a region.\r\nFor more information about digital interactive map kiosks please visit “info.hktdc.com“:http://info.hktdc.com.

A successful transformation of the Michigan Avenue Corridor into such an area requires a downtown atmosphere that offers a comfortable, engaging and secure environment for pedestrians.   Though transportation within the corridor will be affected by both public and private modes, the ability for a pedestrian to navigate in a safe and efficient manner is crucial to the process of urban revitalization.\r\n\r\nWithin the corridor, a few innovative changes could serve to increase public safety and help to eliminate pedestrian hazards.  Such changes could be the utilization of pedestrian and traffic detection devices at crosswalks and traffic lights, an increase in pedestrian level street lighting and the implementation of a public/pedestrian safety committee.   With a newfound, or increased feeling of safety and security, it is the hope of many that the Michigan Avenue Corridor will one day be a creative city bustling with pedestrian activity.  \r\n \r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/37711425@N02/3479447188/\" title=\"DSC00542 by chenow10, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3382/3479447188_bb6f29f23f.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"DSC00542\" /></a>\r\n\r\nPedestrian and traffic detection devices at crosswalks and traffic lights have been used in multiple cities around the country.  The following link, \"www.pbworld.com\":http://www.pbworld.com, gives examples of areas in which such measures have been taken to improve pedestrian safety. It also gives a brief overview of some of the technology incorporated in the use of the various devices, providing visuals as well. \"www.walkinginfo.org\":http://www.walkinginfo.org provides more detailed information regarding in-pavement lighting systems including two cities in which such systems have been implemented.  For more information on a functional pedestrian safety committee and the impact it has had on a local community please see \"www.ci.slc.ut.us\":http://www.ci.slc.ut.us.\r\n\r\nThere are various strategies that could be implemented using pedestrian and traffic detection devices at crosswalks and traffic lights.  Devices that make use of infrared, microwave or video technologies are a more long-term and modern approach.  A short-term and cost-friendly alternative would be a simple crosswalk flag system in which pedestrians would carry a small brightly colored flag at crossings.  Both options could be implemented in different areas of the corridor depending on the frequency of pedestrian activity and traffic. \r\n\r\nThe use of an infrared detection system is one way to increase pedestrian safety.  In a specific area, usually the crosswalk and correlating curbs, these devices containing thermal radiation detectors can sense a change in heat when a person crosses or approaches a crossing.  Crossing time is then increased or decreased based on presence of pedestrians.   Microwave detection systems are another option.  These systems emit electromagnetic energy into a target area, or crosswalk.  If the device detects the energy being reflected in the crosswalk or curb, just like the infrared detector, it allows for more time to be given accounting for pedestrian crossing.  \r\n\r\nBoth infrared and microwave detection devices seem to be more modern and long-term solutions to decreasing pedestrian hazards throughout the corridor, however, implementation could serve to be costly and time consuming.  While the gradual process of installing these devices in the busiest and most dense pedestrian areas began, a simple, community oriented and cost-friendly option could be explored.  \r\n\r\nBrightly colored or reflective flags could be placed in containers on both ends of crosswalks.  Pedestrians would utilize the crosswalk flags by holding them as they crossed, making them stand out more to traffic.  In Salt Lake City, such a system has been adopted.  To keep the flag containers stocked, the city has created an “Adopt a Crosswalk” program in which local businesses pay to refill the flag containers and monitor them.\r\n\r\nFor more information on a vast array of pedestrian safety technology including the previously mentioned safety systems, please visit \"www.walkinginfo.org\":http://www.walkinginfo.org. \r\n\r\nAnother option for enhancing pedestrian safety is to increase pedestrian level street lighting.  An increase in street lighting in general would serve to benefit the community. Well-lit areas are characteristically safer and less hazardous as far as accidents and crime are concerned.  In-pavement street lighting is becoming a common practice in many urban areas and has been implemented in around the country.  Such a system could provide a bright and less hazardous environment for people walking or biking in the Michigan Avenue Corridor. \r\n\r\nThe basic function of an in-pavement street lighting system is to alert approaching traffic to the presence of pedestrians.  Lights are placed on both sides of a crosswalk and angled toward oncoming traffic.  The lights flash when a pedestrian is using the crosswalk and continue to do so until an adequate crossing time has been allowed.  These systems can be used alongside infrared and microwave detection devices in order to make crossing time more accurate or extended based on individual pedestrian needs.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/37711425@N02/3478634227/\" title=\"DSC00527 by chenow10, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3545/3478634227_9729b18480.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"DSC00527\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn-pavement lighting systems are becoming relatively common in many urban areas.  In Pemberton, New Jersey, residents and school administrators employed such a system in order to minimize hazards to children in a school zone.  A specific crosswalk was targeted using an in-pavement system, as well as fluorescent stripping.  For more information on the success of this system in Pemberton, New Jersey, please see “www.state.nj.us”:http://www.state.nj.us.  For more information on in-pavement lighting systems such as product information and installation please visit \"www.lightguardsystems.com\":http://www.lightguardsystems.com.\r\n\r\nImplementing a public/pedestrian safety committee is another way in which pedestrian safety could be enriched inside the Corridor.  A committee or group of local residents or commuters, who are familiar with the Michigan Avenue Corridor and its needs, would come together to ensure that the safest environment possible is provided.  Such a committee would be a public forum in which problems, safety issues and public/pedestrian hazards could be brought to the table.  \r\n	\r\nIn some areas, pedestrian safety committees are an extension of city council.  The committees function in response to problems, as well as taking a pre-emptive approach to trouble-shooting within the realm of pedestrian transportation.  Such committees are responsible for orchestrating safety precautions such as crosswalk flag systems, Adopt a Crosswalk, educational public campaigns and even implementation of enhanced law enforcement and street improvements to protect pedestrians.\r\n\r\nFor more information on active and successful public/pedestrian safety committees please visit the following links.

However, there are some cities that are flourishing despite hard economic times. These are better known as \"creative cities\":http://www.creativecities.com/, and they are succeeding because they’ve embraced a new type of economy; one based on independent, creative businesses. If we were to follow the example of creative cities like Portland and San Francisco and adopt a creative enterprise here in the Capitol, Lansing’s economy could easily be saved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>     The Michigan Avenue Corridor is an excellent starting point for the introduction of a creative economy. Currently, the Corridor is not helping Lansing’s economic situation. The commercial space on Michigan Avenue is mainly comprised of big-name chain companies, especially in the Frandor Shopping Center. And on any given day, Frandor’s massive parking lot is virtually empty. This should not come as a surprise, as one of the most important factors in the success story of Portland, Oregon, has been embracing independent businesses. Some of the residents’ favorite spots in Portland are coffeehouses, boutiques, and music venues, all locally run.  Our Corridor lacks creative businesses like those in Portland, which turns away the vital \"creative class\":http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0205.florida.html\r\n that is right next door at Michigan State University. If the city were to change and specify commercial zoning laws, this problem could be solved. By setting aside a certain amount of commercial zones for independent businesses, Lansing would be encouraging new businesses to come to our city. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>     In addition to tweaking zoning laws, Lansing legislators could make small changes to the city’s budget to give funding to incoming small-business owners and entrepreneurs. While this could require an increase in taxes, it would encourage new business in the Capitol and thus new economic opportunities for residents. Portland has shown that while economic success does not happen without sacrifice, the outcome is well worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>     There is also a way to adapt existing Lansing-based companies to the economic changes. Many corporations today are providing creativity training to their employees as a means of preparing for a creative enterprise, as well as to attract employees from the creative class. There are many companies that offer such training programs, and they are all willing to work with corporations on an individual basis to determine costs, as budgets vary. Despite cost flexibility, some corporations still may not be able to afford such training. However, there are virtually free ways to increase a company’s appeal to employees of the creative class. Experts say that simple changes such as a relaxed dress code and flexible scheduling can transform employees’ attitudes as well as make them more appealing to new, creative employees.</p>\r\n','http://ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/138/big/6EC9B454-2B52-4137-9FE5-A58B3A81DE05.jpg?1260433489',NULL,'an empty lot at Frandor (loopnet.com)',NULL,'2009-12-08 20:48:37','2009-12-13 19:59:58',92,0,NULL,NULL),(162,'Streetscape','Supporting Completing the Street',NULL,'<BIG>Complete Streets</BIG>\r\n\r\n<br>Michigan Avenue Corridor lacks many things; color, ambition, attractiveness, safety, and traits needed to be a successful and safe avenue.

They are cracked, crumbling, and in terrible shape. The problems stems from tree roots growing up through the cement because they aren’t getting enough water. There is, however, a simple and cost-effective solution to this reoccurring problem.\r\n\r\n!http://www.reservestudy.com/images/contest6-06_bad_sidewalk.jpg!\r\n\r\nThe *solution* to the shifting sidewalk problem is rubber sidewalks. Rubber sidewalks are composed of interlocking panels made out of 100% recycled material from old tires. Because they are made out of rubber, they *will not* crack under pressure from tree roots beneath. Traditional cement cracks because it does not allow water to seep, and tree roots grow up looking for water. This causes scenes similar to the one pictured above and are all too common on the corridor.\r\n\r\n\"Rubber sidewalks\":http://rubbersidewalks.com/pdf/Fact_Sheet.pdf  have many qualities that make them a clear choice over cement:\r\n\r\n•	They are porous, meaning that water will seep through them and go directly into the ground below allowing water to go directly into the tree roots.\r\n•	They do no crack or chip under freezing and subzero temperatures.\r\n•	 They can be picked up and reset into new positions, making it easy and cheap to fix shifts.\r\n•	They last minimum of 20 years, three to four     times longer than cement and other comparable materials such as asphalt.\r\n\r\n!http://www.lhdesignbuild.com/content/LC/img/2008/07/LC200807_69.jpg!\r\n\r\nRubber sidewalks also hold up much better in the cold Michigan weather. There is a small section of rubber sidewalk, similar to the one above, near my dorm building, and they are not shifted or cracked, despite the cold thaw-freeze weather. They can be shoveled and snowplowed just as easily as cement. When walking on the cement nearby, I noticed that the surface of the cement becomes slippery when snow melts and re-freezes on it. However, because water flows easily through the rubber sidewalk panels and cannot sit on the surface, they do not have any ice and are much less slippery. They also have enough texture on the surface to create a solid, stable, gripping surface.\r\n\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-12-08 20:53:10','2009-12-13 21:04:37',97,4,NULL,NULL),(171,'Business Development','Why Wi-Fi Works',NULL,'<p>      As Michigan’s capital city, Lansing needs to attract, invite, and appeal to visitors and residents in both appearance and essence. A variety of projects have been proposed, and some even put into action from going green to painting buildings and fixing sidewalks. However, what the city needs is more than just a fresh coat of paint. Lansing needs something new and exciting, something fun yet productive. The answer, I believe, is making *free Wi-Fi* available on Michigan Avenue. \r\n<p>     *Municipal broadband networks* have been proven to be a _success_ in cities across America, as well as foreign countries. Wireless Internet is even being offered in Lansing’s own backyard on Michigan State University’s campus. The Internet would allow the residents and visitors of the city of Lansing to do a variety of things. Wi-Fi has proven to be _most useful_ in the following ways:\r\n\r\n•	staying connected to friends and family through the use of Facebook or email\r\n•	shopping for groceries, clothes, or household and work supplies\r\n•	paying bills\r\n•	applying for jobs\r\n•	access health information quickly\r\n•	allowing public safety officials to access information quicker and more efficiently\r\n<p>      Providing a service such as Wi-Fi to a public city would attract people, which in turn would heighten the population. This would be great for Lansing particularly because it has been experiencing a population decline over that past few years. As more people come to the city, more businesses will flourish and grow. Adding a municipal broadband network will also make Lansing a technologically advanced city, which is important in this day and age. \r\n<p>      Although the 30,000-dollar monthly cost is pricy, there are ways to eliminate the costs if the product is desired. Donations and bargaining with the broadband companies by city officials can decrease the amount tremendously (to about 10,000-dollars a year).

As people are drawn to the technology the city has to offer, they will begin to come to the city, bringing with them their culture, creativity, and business.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Images courtesy of:*\r\nhttp://cdn-write.demandstudios.com/upload//8000/900/30/0/158930.jpg\r\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/images/376259/0_61_wi_fi_use.jpg\r\n','http://www.foxnews.com/images/376259/0_61_wi_fi_use.jpg','http://cdn-write.demandstudios.com/upload//8000/900/30/0/158930.jpg',NULL,NULL,'2009-12-08 20:53:22','2009-12-16 16:06:35',102,4,NULL,NULL),(172,'Streetscape','Satisfying Sidewalks',NULL,'The sidewalks down the Michigan Avenue Corridor are *not* in the best condition.

Since Michigan State is one of the largest campuses in the United States, having bike lanes and high-quality sidewalks may bring more people from Michigan State University to the Michigan Avenue Corridor. This will allow companies to have more customers and get more business. High-quality sidewalks will make it easier for people to walk or bike from Michigan State University to Lansing. \r\n\r\nAnother benefit of sidewalks is an improved environment. Since more people will use the sidewalks instead of their automobiles, the environment will have cleaner air due to less gas being used. More people will be outside on sidewalks interacting with each other which will make Lansing a connected community.  \r\n\r\nHealthier individuals, business promotion and an improved environment will create an enjoyable appearance for people.

Among the important landmarks that stand alongside this plain road are the Capital Building and the one of the largest universities in the country. It is essential to the transportation from east to west and is geographically the main vein of Lansing. The simple problem of it though, is that it is treated almost exclusively as a way point, while lacking a heavy shopping, or residential quality to it. The Corridor needs to be extensively overhauled in order to cater to the necessities of pedestrian capacity and there are several essential improvements that could achieve this. \r\n\r\nThe main problems that I have noticed and that my research has proven to be fixable are the areas sidewalks as well as the building storefronts and facades. People in the area and most certainly myself would be much more inclined to spend more time around the Corridor, shopping or eating in restaurants if these pedestrian amenities were to be improved.\r\n\r\nIn many sections of the road the largest problem with the sidewalks is the width thereof. City money put towards widening the sidewalks would be a good investment. We would find a much greater density of foot traffic if pedestrians were to be using well kept, comfortably widened pathways.\r\n\r\nThe second problem with the Corridor is the storefronts and facades along the street. Many of them are ugly, plain, or just run-down and seedy. Facade grants would be a good option to pay for them and there are many construction companies that specialize specifically in the renovation and reconstruction of building fronts.

This is because art can enhance the quality of life of a community and the citizen’s within that community. We as a community need to raise younger generations to be socially conscious if we are going to have a culturally educated society in years to come.

Biking is especially popular with the students of Michigan State University. Because Lansing is in such close proximity to the MSU campus, bike lanes should be added to the Michigan Ave. Corridor. Bike lanes are a designated space for travel on the street. The production of bike lanes can: \r\n   * Promote bike \"safety\":http://www.cambridgema.gov/~CDD/et/bike/bike_safety.html\r\n   * Make Lansing, and its surrounding communities, environmentally friendly\r\n   * Increase the number of volunteers in Lansing\r\n\r\n<h1>Safety</h1>\r\nBicyclists riding in areas without bike paths or lanes are nearly twice as likely to feel \"endangered\":https://www.bts.gov/publications/issue_briefs/number_11/html/entire.html. With the presence of bike lanes, those riding bikes would have a designated route for travel. The production of bike lanes would decrease bike-to-pedestian accidents, and could also reduce bike-to-motor vehicle accidents. This is because with the presence of bike lanes bicyclists are less likely to ride out in front of cars. Also, by separating bicyclists from walking pedestrians those biking can make it easier for bicyclists to reach their destination. This is because those biking would no longer have to weave in and out of walking pedestrians. \r\n\r\n<h1>Helping the Environment</h1>\r\nAccording to many statistics, with the presense of bike lanes, people are more likely to ride their bicycles. So, if bike lanes are added to the Michigan Ave. Corridor we can reduce the amount of fuel used for cars and public transportation. As shown in the above photos, public transportation is just one of the popular means of transportation. Biking is also very popular in the Lansing Area, as shown in the first picture.

This would make the Greater Lansing Community a \"greener\":http://www.skidmore.edu/www/academics/IPC/cec/links/green_campuses_compared.doc community. \r\n\r\n<h1>Cost</h1>\r\nThe \"cost\":http://www.walkinginfo.org/engineering/roadway-bicycle.cfm of producing a bike lane would cost anywhere from $5,000 to $50,000 per mile. This cost could be reduced <i>significantly</i> by getting the citizens of the Greater Lansing Community involved in the process.\r\n\r\n<h1>Volunteer!</h1>\r\nBeing that many of the people living in the Lansing area are students at Michigan State University, these students are looking for as much volunteer experience as they can get. This volunteer experinence will make students, as well as adults, more <b>marketable</b> in the world. By getting the citizens of Lansing to volunteer, the cost could be reduced, and a stronger community could be built.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstalling bike lanes on the Michigan Ave. Corridor would make biking a more efficient mode of transportation.

One of the ways that cities have changed to meet the environment is with the movement of recycling.\r\n    One of the large factors driving this movement is the preservation of the future. More and more people are becoming concerned with making sure that future generations can have the same opportunities that we have now. Recycling offers that to us by reusing and preserving resources, making cleaner and more productive cities, and increasing jobs and economy.  One of the best ways to improve and progress the future of Michigan Avenue Corridor is by implementing a curbside recycling program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_*What can be recycled?*_\r\n\r\n    By providing recycling bins to the public it will help keep Michigan Avenue a cleaner and more productive part of Lansing. The recycling of resources such as: \r\n * aluminum\r\n * glass\r\n * paper\r\n * plastic\r\n * steel \r\n\r\n_*Benifits*_\r\n\r\n Adding separate recyclable units to the sidewalks of Michigan Ave Corridor will help create more jobs and a more productive city. By providing the streets with recyclable bins, a need for workers to pick up the recyclables is required. This will help create jobs for locals and with more people employed stimulate the local economy. Not only will providing recycling bins to the street help create jobs but will also conserve and cut back on the amount of virgin resources used to create new products. Help keep Lansing a cleaner and more productive city by supporting the movement of recycling. \r\n\r\n_*Other Resources*_\r\n\r\nTo find out more about curbside recycling check this web link out...\"here\":http://earth911.com','C:/fakepath/PB120870.JPG','C:\\Users\\Morgan\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Temporary Internet Files\\Low\\Content.IE5\\ZF8DGDKI\\PB120869[1].JPG','The current receptical system in Lansing.','If the recepticals are there people will use them.','2009-12-08 21:03:56','2009-12-15 15:29:51',105,2,NULL,NULL),(178,'Dense Mixed Use','Connecting Parks',NULL,'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The Michigan Avenue corridor* provides a critical connection between the cities of Lansing and East Lansing, Michigan.

Not only will our signs be somehow associated with Michigan State but everything to our street furniture, our buses, the interior of our buildings, and anything else you could possibly think of!

It makes me feel important, as if I attend a school that is significant. When devoting time and effort into something like your school, it becomes a big part of your life. When that something is succeeding or well known you feel proud that you go there. However, if it is threatened or not succeeding you feel the opposite, or you are like me and you try and find a way to change it. \r\n\r\nSo that is why I say we \"change the corridor\":http://capitalgainsmedia.com/features/miave0332.aspx.

Just being over in the Michigan Avenue area is a negative experience.  Traffic is always condensed and the hideous surroundings just make the area that much more unbearable.  The reason why this roadway needs to be renovated is because it connects us to a piece of history, our State Capital building. \r\n\r\n  One plan that many experts in the field have come up with is to add nature to the surroundings.  This means adding trees, shrubs, roadside parks, and other landscaping materials.  This will greatly help add life and culture to the area.  Also adding these things will help the city save money.  Trees are very useful in storm water management.  They would soak up a lot of the rainstorm water, so that our sewage systems dont become overburden.  Another advantage to doing this is atmosphere.  A green luscious area creates a positive terrain, while a dead, lifeless terrain creates a negative feeling.\r\nOne last idea I have come across is adding \"green roofs\":http://www.greenroofs.org/index.php/about-green-roofs/2577-aboutgrnroofs to the area.  These are roofs with plants and flowers on them.  They are very useful because they combat storm water runoff, produce life, and are very pleasing to look at.  Oh ya I almost forgot, they will save the consumer much money.  They help cool your house in the summer and help heat it in the winter.  This reduces much energy being used and saves you a lot of money.  And isnt this the idea to create a greener tomorrow?

As stated by Di Boyer (1) in an article about a new park, “If you can go and get a green experience in your city, there is no reason to drive further out and create more pollution.”  Sparrow could also become a much more active player in the revival effort such as the one John Hopkins Hospital(2) is playing in Baltimore.    \r\n\r\nSparrow could do this by:\r\n•Supporting the construction of medians\r\n•Helping to build the equivalent of company housing\r\n•Aiding in the destruction of old buildings\r\n\r\nThe other things that must be added are small medians(3) where the bright yellow turn lanes are.

Glazier',NULL,'<strong>About Stephanie</strong>\r\n<p>Stephanie was raised in the area between Alpina and Harrisville in Michigan; Alpena is situated on Thunder Bay and Harrisville on Lake Huron. She was compelled to come to attend Michigan State University, a four hour drive from her hometown, because it presented her with a good program that would allow her to further her education. As a freshman, Stephanie was a Psychology major but at the beginning of her sophomore year she changed her major to English.<br/>\r\n24 years old, Stephanie lives and works in the Greater Lansing/East Lansing area. She is currently pursuing a Master of Fine Arts (MFA). She is currently attending Antioch, a college in Las Angeles, CA, through online and email contact. Her professor/mentor in the program is Carol Potter, who resides in Vermont. Stephanie says this type of schooling suites her writing life, as it mimics an artist’s life. This type of study and “homework” is pursued in a realistic form that is similar to what a professional author experiences. The program is very self-directed and could be loosely compared to an undergraduate’s independent study.<br/>\r\nStephanie began writing poetry in her senior year of college when she attended a book arts class in the Residential College of Arts and Humanities (RCAH). Her professor was a poet, who ended up being a large influence in Stephanie’s career and continual education as a poet. After this class, Stephanie began writing poetry seriously, especially with all of her experience through the workshops in the class. A favorite poet of Stephanie’s is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Oliver\" target=\"_blank\">Mary Oliver</a>, who was described by Stephanie as having a “very nature and spiritual oriented poetry” style.</p>\r\n<strong>Writing Process</strong>\r\n<p>Concerning poetry as an outlet for emotions and free speech, Stephanie stated that “poetry is meaningful in a world of meaninglessness.” She feels that through the act of writing, editing, and sharing poetry (both her own and other’s) it is the best way to say what isn’t being said or what wasn’t said out loud.<br/>\r\nGenerally a sporadic poet, Stephanie will write bits and pieces of poetry wherever and whenever it suits her artistic side. Her preferred method of writing is with pen and paper, however, with extensive edits she will consent to applying her writing process to a digital medium.<br/>\r\nOnce a week, however, she will set aside time at home in order to collect all of her poems of the past week. On this day she will go through each piece and cohesively develop a single piece. Because of this single planned day, Stephanie demonstrates a very relaxed writing process that requires a day to be set aside to let this process finalize into a finalized and polished piece. \r\nThe atmospheres in which she likes to write vary from one to the next. Because she has such a sporadic writing style, many of the places in which she finds herself writing are grocery stores, on campus, in her chapel, bakery stores. She likes to write in the chapel because she appreciates the atmospheric light within the building. The cafés that she has written in are Wanderer’s Teahouse, owned and operated by an MSU alum; Gone Wired Café, a café on Michigan Ave; and Chapelure, a café and bakery on Hagadorn Rd.</p>\r\n<img src=\"http://www.capitalgainsmedia.com/images/Locations/CG%20Eastside/Eat/_s/East-Gone-wired-111-9068.jpg\" alt=\"Gone Wired Cafe\">\r\n<strong>Inspiration for Poetry</strong>\r\n<p>The inspiration for much of Stephanie’s continued poetry comes from the Center for Poetry, where she works as the Assistant to the Director. The center holds workshops, slams, and in every spring hosts the Fest of Listening where non-English speaking poets read their poetry in their native language without translation. The center has been in operation for four years, and Stephanie has been working as Assistant to the Director for the past three.<br/>\r\nWhen asked “What is the most important element of your work?” Stephanie responded almost immediately with the answer of “Dedication.” When asked in a different way “What emotion do you feel the most after you’ve completed a finished work?” she responded with “Pride.” She made a comment towards those who look at poetry as being such a small work and relatively easy don’t realize how much hard work goes into creating a good, finished poem. Not just a poem that you spout off in 5 minutes, but a poem that has meaning and substance. <br/>\r\nStephanie Glazier is <a href=\"http://lansingonlinenews.com/news/poemaday-pat-robertson-i-hate-you-by-stephanie-m-glazier/\" target=\"_blank\">published locally</a> and she coordinates poetry events at the MSU campus and East Lansing district schools through the Center for Poetry. </p>\r\n\r\n<strong>Center for Poetry</strong>\r\n<ul list-style=\"none\">\r\n<li>Email: atcpoetry@msu.edu</li>\r\n<li>Website: http://rcah.msu.edu/poetry</li>\r\n<li>Phone #: 517.884.1932</li>\r\n<li>Address: C210 Snyder Hall, East Lansing, MI 48825-1106</li>\r\n</ul> ','http://rcah.msu.edu/images/gallery/photos/n721781779_748993_1850_opt.jpg',NULL,'Center for Poetry and a public chalking.',NULL,'2010-11-23 22:13:30','2010-11-23 23:02:53',139,1,NULL,NULL),(200,'Environmental Sustainability','Reducing Emissions at Michigan State University',NULL,'<b><h2>The Problem</b></h2><img src=\"http://www.wearepowershift.org/sites/wearepowershift.org/files/photo-1.jpg\" height=\"240px\" width=\"240px\">\r\nCoal is the leading attributor to global warming and is responsible for 83% of the carbon dioxide emissions. \r\n\r\nHere at MSU we have the countrys largest on campus coal power plant.

One form of transportation that has caught the eyes of society has been around for decades; the bicycle. Bike lanes and their safety, is a new age idea that has many people weighing the benefits and downfalls, before taking action. Those who see bike lanes as beneficial, not only see the safety of society but the possibility of growth of alternate forms of transportation. They see bike lanes as a safe alternative for car riders, pedestrians, and bicyclists. \r\n\r\nh2. Safety\r\n\r\nBike lanes not only affect drivers on the road, but pedestrians on the sidewalk. Bicycles add a great amount of traffic and stress to pedestrians on the sidewalk. As a result, with bike lanes being put in the street, the traffic on the sidewalk is greatly decreased. In turn traveling speeds are increased and the sidewalk becomes a more attractive place for pedestrians. Along with the problem of growing gas prices, a major problem has become pollution in the world. It’s easy to understand that the more cars on the road, the greater amount of pollution will occur. Since then the world has developed drastically: the global population has more than doubled and the global energy consumption by nearly a factor of five.  With more bicycles and less cars, the Greater Lansing area will contribute to a “greener” environment. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/new-york-city-bike-lane-flickr-kyle-gradinger-500.jpg\" width=\"200px\" height=\"240\">\r\n\r\nh3.

Some roads around campus have already been equipped with bike lanes to aid students getting to and from class. However, many roads lack the ability to support a bike lane. Therefore, it would cost either the university or the state a great amount of money to add these bike lanes.

This would directly help people with asthma and allergies. One mature tree can produce enough oxygen to support two humans for their entire life. Trees can also reduce smog formation and this will be beneficial for Lansing, which is a rapidly growing city. Trees will create new habitats for the natural wildlife in Lansing. Trees will increase property value and lower electric bills since they create shade in the summer and cool the buildings down. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/MSU_forest_trail.jpg/225px-MSU_forest_trail.jpg\" width=\"200px\"  	height=\"240\">\r\n\r\nh1=. Success Story\r\n\r\nIn Minnesota, there is a company called Tree Trust. They strive to improve the community environment by investing in people. They have several different programs, including volunteering or employment. Since 1976, Tree Trust has employed more than 42,000 youth and adults. They also have had more than 13,000 volunteers and planted 72,000 trees. Something similar to this idea would be ideal for Lansing.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.treetrust.org/\">Tree Trust</a> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9iAYDKY2mdI/TE8GKZt2QJI/AAAAAAAAANw/ace-JW1XDxg/s1600/Green+Futures+Minnetrista,+Spring+2010+006.JPG\" width=\"200px\"  	height=\"240\">\r\n\r\nh1=. Opposing Viewpoint\r\n\r\np. Lansing has faced some financial challenges in the past few years due to decline in property taxes and decreases in state funding. With this being said, planting trees along one street probably isn’t at the top of the city’s list. Planting trees would be pretty costly initially when you include purchasing trees, digging dirt, buying fertilizer, hiring landscapers, and maintaining the foliage. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.pghlux.com/links/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/landscape-planting-tree.jpg\" width=\"240px\" height=\"200\">\r\n\r\n\r\n','http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3642/3399543090_dda97d9cce_z.jpg',NULL,'Beautiful scenery on MSU campus',NULL,'2012-04-24 17:40:58','2012-04-26 14:09:30',217,11,NULL,NULL),(203,'Environmental Sustainability','Frandor Area and Red Cedar Park',NULL,'<img src=\"http://lormaxstern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Frandor-Mall-Aerial.jpg\" width=\"600px\"height=\"400\">\r\n\r\nThis image shows an aerial overview of the Frandor area.  The upper left is the unused Red Cedar Golf Course and the road parallel to Saginaw by the course and Sears is Michigan Avenue.  As you can see about 75% of the ground is pavement.  The runoff from pollution and storms will eventually get into the Red Cedar River and harm the environment.  On the other hand, building a nice park on the golf course will attract many people to the area and boost the businesses at the mall.  With the close proximity of Michigan State University and the expressway, the Frandor Mall and park would be very popular and successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Example of a Striving City \r\n\r\nThe city of Greenville, South Carolina has started living up to its name.  The city has enacted a master plan to become environmentally friendly and uses this as their basis for their economy.  They have 39 parks covering over 500 acres and studies have shown that these parks, when well maintained, boost property values. The city hires more workers and the parks get the maintenance they need while more people get jobs.  Greenville’s website also details their public transit, special events, housing, and government. <a href=\"http://www.greenvillesc.gov/default.aspx\">Greenville City Home</a>   This city in South Carolina has already taken many of the steps Lansing needs to do with Michigan Avenue and Greenville seems to be a large success.\r\n\r\nh3.

The increased draw to the area once the Red Cedar Park is added will increase activity in the area and draw more people to the nearby Frandor Mall.  Once some money is poured into Michigan Ave I believe it will really prosper.  These improvements should be eco friendly and will overall make the corridor more appealing.

The greatest cities in the world have one thing in common; unity. Great cities have residents that truly care about each other and their overall surroundings. With unity and a sense of pride, a city, like Lansing, will prosper. There is no better way to create pride than by creating a city park. A park is not simply a place to walk the dog or have a picnic. A park is a place to see the beauty of nature as well as provide a place to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life. They provide a place for tranquility and give the community something to be proud of. Lansing is the state capitol of Michigan, and should therefore represent the state.\r\n\r\nh3<>. A Capitol City No-One Wants to See\r\n\r\np<>. <a href=\"http://www.walkscore.com/\">Walk Score</a> gave Lansing, MI a score of 48 out of 100. The state capitol should be a place where the community can come together and make important decisions that affect them every day. New York, New York received a score of 85. almost double that of Lansing. Largely due to the prospering Central Park.\r\n\r\n*_Lansing_*\r\n\r\n	<img src=\"http://www.exponent.com/files/Uploads/Images/exposure/park.jpg\" width=\"300px\"  	height=\"200\">\r\n\r\nbq.

The benefits of city parks have been seen in some of the greatest cities in the United States. For example <a href=\" http://www.centralparknyc.org/\">Central Park</a> in New York,  Grant Park in Chicago, and Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. All of which have a prospering economy with a growing number of jobs. Parks allow the community to benefit in multiple ways. The first is through public health. A park gives a place for people to exercise in a safe and encouraging environment. The second benefit is economical. A park will raise property values for the surrounding community which will attract new businesses and will therefore increase tourism. The community will also benefit socially. A park provides a location for members of the community to get out of their homes and meet new people with similar interests, through activities such as sports.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.wired.com/playbook/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Playing-circle-rules-1.jpg\" width=\"200px\"  	height=\"240\">\r\n\r\n\r\nbq. “The purpose of parks metamorphosed, but they remain so important to cities that even during the Great Depression many park systems received large influxes of money and attention through the federal government’s relief and conservation programs.” --Peter Harkin\r\n\r\nh4.

Even greater is that is runs right on through the capital of the state, Lansing. Healthy transportation along this stretch is scarce, at best. Personal vehicle use accounts for over 90% of personal travel. Although there are many other options available rather than car, such as biking, walking, and public transportation, the majority of the area still falls back to their nasty habit; personal vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Public Transit\r\n\r\nTransportation is the single largest emitter of greenhouse gas in the United State. On the other hand one bus of six people is six times more efficient than a car with one person in it. The Corridor offers many public transportation services such as Cata, which has been pushing to make the Avenue healthier for all.  Recently they have introduces the MiniHybrid Thermal System, which helps to get better fuel efficiency and also reduces emissions. In order to make this new technology worth it, the Lansing community needs to utilize this means of transportation, and leave the car keys at home.\r\n<img src=\"http://dieselman.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/cata-bus.jpg\" width=\"500px\" height=\"350\">\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nh3. Bicycling/Walking\r\n\r\n\r\nBicycling on the avenue cuts back on obesity and on average only cost $400, saving you thousands on gas money. Bicycling as well as walking also builds the community. While many people argue that they are slow and inconvenient, it’s apparent that all great cities implement these systems to build revenue and lower emissions. Slower speeds allow people to see stores and business they might not see in a car, as well as providing zero emissions. \r\n\r\n+Future Ideas for the Avenue+\r\n<a href=\"http://www.wellhome.com/blog/2011/02/top-bizarre-new-public-transportation-ideas//\">Future Transportation</a> \r\n<a href=\"http://www.cahighspeedrail.ca.gov/\">Bullet Trains</a> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.leslie2k.com/images/Bus%20Bike%20Rack.gif\" width=\"400px\" height=\"350\">\r\n\r\nThe time to make a difference is now!

The street is focused primarily around the use of cars yet lacks an appropriate route for pedestrians and bikers.\r\n  \r\np. The sidewalk that runs along both sides of the avenue does not accommodate all pedestrians, especially those with disabilities who <br> rely on crosswalks or lowered curbs at intersections. Also the majority of Michigan Avenue has <a href=\"http://i187.photobucket.com/albums/x234/Danikate04/MA_limit_parking.jpg\">parking along the shoulder</a> or no shoulder at all forcing bikers to ride directly in the street with traffic.\r\n\r\np. Therefore improvements must be made to transform Michigan Avenue into a complete street that accommodates all travelers.\r\n\r\nh4. Steps:\r\n \r\n* *Implement Traffic Calming Regulations*\r\n- Enforce slower speeds\r\n- Limit available parking\r\n* *Accommodate Bikers*\r\n- Develop bike lanes\r\n- Establish bicycle parking\r\n* *Welcome Pedestrians*\r\n- Improve sidewalks, structure and design\r\n- Provide adequate crosswalks\r\n- Add signage, lighting, and benches\r\n\r\nh3. Change is Good\r\n\r\nThe immense benefits that this plan provides are crucial to the Lansing area. Aside from significant improvements in safety, through slower speeds and designated bike lanes, improvements in health, accessibility, and the environment will be made as well. In addition, shared space techniques will encourage people to explore the street, engaging with one another and ultimately growing as a community. \r\n \r\np. Many cities around the world are working towards completing their streets as well and have experienced great success. The following presentation describes in depth the essential need for complete streets along with results and photos from several cities. It is full of facts, graphs, and charts making it easy to see that this plan produces wonderful results and is desperately needed on Michigan Avenue. \r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:425px\" id=\"__ss_749854\"> <iframe src=\"http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/749854\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe> <div style=\"padding:5px 0 12px\"> </div>\r\n\r\n\r\np.

A way that bike riding will become safer and more convenient is if bicycle lanes are inserted on the streets and sidewalks of East Lansing.  Bike lanes will provide areas for bicyclists to get from place to place without causing traffic or interference with pedestrians. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/bike-lane.jpg\" width=\"150px\"  	height=\"190\">\r\n\r\n\r\nMSU Bicycle Information\r\n\r\nMSU promotes bicycling as a safe, fun, economical, efficient, environmentally friendly and healthy transportation alternative for the campus community.

Bikes lanes will prevent accidents from happening and they will force people to get on their bikes and ride through the city.  Biking will allow citizens to gain exercise through simple transportation from one place to the next and decrease the amount of traffic on the roads.  Constructing bike lanes will transform East Lansing into a more convivial city to live in. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://statenews.com/media/00/00/04/32/43232_mdh_new_bikesafety_040611f.jpg\" width=\"340px\"  	height=\"240\">\r\n\r\n\r\nLarge Number of Bicyclists \r\n\r\nThe number of students who ride their bikes throughout the city of East Lansing is overwhelming.

There are accidents every day due to the bad conditions of the streets. In 2009, there were nearly 5.5 million car accidents in the United States alone. Along those lines, at any given moment, there are over 800 thousand people driving cars while also on their cell phones. When mixing those statistics with the terrible road conditions in Michigan, there is a huge problem that needs to be solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Every year, United States citizens lose thousands of dollars to the government on things that we never even see being put to use. By fixing roads in East Lansing, the community members would be happy so see with their own eyes, their money being put to use. Governor Rick Snyder has proposed a 40 dollar tax on every car to annually fix up streets across the state! This would be perfect for EL, Michigan State Universities’ campus and the community. \r\n\r\nRick Snyder as he fights for change.\r\n<img src=\"http://cmsimg.freep.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=C4&Date=20111026&Category=NEWS06&ArtNo=110260370&Ref=V2&MaxW=300&Border=0&Gov-Rick-Snyder-propose-40-annual-fee-fix-roads\" width=\"240px\"  	height=\"190\">\r\n\r\n    Other cities similar to East Lansing across the country have started to repave and fix up their streets. In Toronto, they have come up with a plan called <a href=\"http://www.toronto.ca/transportation/roads/road_repairs.htm\">The Toronto Project</a>,to fix the roads so that tax payers will be happy. The city has found that roads have a lifespan of about 18 to 25 years. So every 20 years, inspectors look over the roads in Toronto and evaluate if they need to be repaired. They are now fixing these roads and the city of East Lansing can observe and follow in these footsteps. Similarly, in the state of California, the city of Orinda has an annual repair project. But Orinda allocates anywhere from 600 thousand to 1.2 million dollars each year to road repair. These are ideas that the East Lansing community and the State of Michigan can use to improve our streets. It is so important that the government starts to act to cut money from other projects so they can put it towards ones that affect entire communities like the community of East Lansing, Michigan!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ci.orinda.ca.us/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={AC8E74AD-CC00-4BF8-BA4D-E3F56C63FCBE}\">Orinda California </a> \r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.ci.orinda.ca.us/vertical/Sites/%7B1FFFBF8B-A9AE-44E8-AA2B-A96F02EF1AFF%7D/uploads/%7BAAE77263-0BE7-465B-8DA1-9410289E9EC9%7D.JPG\" width=\"320px\"  	height=\"220\">\r\nWorkers fixing up not just the roads, but the community as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-04-24 17:44:31','2012-05-03 01:05:00',192,1,NULL,NULL),(211,'Environmental Sustainability','Transforming the Red Cedar using Rain Gardens',NULL,'<h3> Why Rain Gardens for Michigan Avenue? </h3>\r\nHave you ever walked in downtown Lansing and seen a patch of green vegetation on the sidewalk, fenced in by a little black fence? This is called a rain garden and they filter out contaminants from reaching rivers and waterways. Some are already are being used in the downtown area. \r\n\r\nRain gardens serve the same purpose as storm drains. If rain gardens are designed properly they can absorb thousands of gallons of water. Therefore, it will prevent the Red Cedar from flooding. In comparison to storm drains, rain gardens are more cost efficient and provide a “greener” region. Storm drains in Greater Lansing will collect trash and pollutants which will go directly into the Red Cedar River. Making eco friendly decisions for the future such as utilizing rain gardens will be an encouraging aspect for establishing a better environment. The improvement will be noticeable as the Red Cedar looks cleaner and the ecosystem thrives.\r\n<div style=\"float:left;\">\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/0xkwD.jpg\" width=\"200px\"  	height=\"240\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/QrsUo.jpg\" width=\"200px\"  	height=\"240\">\r\n<caption align=\"bottom\"><B> Left: rain garden / Right: storm drain\r\nWhich one of these look nicer?</B></caption>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3> A chance for Success </h3> \r\n\r\n In the suburbs of Seattle, residents experienced the positive advantages of having rain gardens. The region suffered from heavy rain fall which caused sewers to overflow. Rain gardens were implemented in another Seattle suburb but they were implemented incorrectly. Rain gardens have a proven success when the research is done properly. In this neighborhood where the city did all the required research it was a <a href=\"http://invw.org/content/ballard-rain-gardens-a-green-solution-gone-wrong/\">successful plan</a>. Rain gardens have had previous succes in the West High Point neighborhood, so it can also work here. Rain gardens have not worked in every environment, however they are already working in Lansing so more of them should be used. \r\n\r\n<h3> Proven Benefits </h3>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.uri.edu/ce/healthylandscapes/raingarden.htm\">Rain gardens will be vastly beneficial</a> for the Michigan Avenue Corridor because they have various functions. Most importantly, they will reduce water pollution from runoff in the Red Cedar River. The plants in the rain garden can use their roots to percolate the water and dispose the pollutants. Moreover, rain gardens will create an abundance of wildlife for useful insects. They will control undesired wildlife like mosquitoes because there will be no standing water.  \r\n\r\n The addition of rain gardens can have a positive impact on the environment of both the East Lansing and Lansing communities.

If Michigan Avenue had more examples of public art I think that more people would be drawn to frequent the area. Not only does a work of art look nice, it also draws a variety of different people to the area surrounding it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen art is introduced to a busy area of a city, it often leads people to move closer to that area. Many people would spend more time around Michigan Avenue if it looked a little more visually appealing. If people spent more time around Michigan Avenue it would mean they would be spending more money at local businesses which would also benefit the Lansing Area.\r\n\r\n<a href=\" http://www.americansforthearts.org/NAPD/files/11989/Millennium.pdf\r\n\"> The Millennium Park Effect </a>\r\nThe link above leads to an article done on Millennium Park in Chicago. I chose to link this article because it talks a lot about the public art installations in the park. It gives good examples of different forms of successful public art pieces such as Cloud Gate (better known as \"The Bean\") and The Crown Fountain. It also talks about how the artworks attract many people to Millennium Park every day. The article also mentions how ever since Millennium Park was built it has encouraged young professionals, retirees and empty-nesters to move back into downtown from the suburbs. \r\n\r\nThere are many ways to incorporate Public art to Michigan Avenue for a very small price.The link below\r\nleads to the REACH studio art website. REACH is an organization in the Lansing area that works with citizens in Lansing, focusing on under privileged youth, to bring more art to their community. REACH is doing a project right now where they are working with teens from the area  designing five different pieces of artwork, that the citizens voted on, to display in different spots around Lansing. I think this is a really great program and it would be great if there could be program like REACH that was just focused on Michigan Avenue.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"www.reachstudioart.org/Programs/TeenOpenStudio/CommunityArtProjects/tabid/1529/Default.aspx \"> Reach Studio Art </a> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-04-24 17:48:14','2012-04-26 03:58:11',182,0,NULL,NULL),(214,'Cooperation','A Green Light for the Pedestrians of East Lansing ',NULL,'p=. <img src=\"http://cfile240.uf.daum.net/image/1754D0414F19A91902991C\" width=\"px500\"  	height=\"55\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.freefoto.com/images/908/16/908_16_864---Green-Man-at-Pedestrian-Crossing_web.jpg\" width=\"500px\"  	height=\"300\">\r\n\r\np=.

For example,NO pollution levels went down by 63% and NO2 levels went down by 41% after Times Square in New York area converted into a pedestrian mall. \r\n\r\n * The area can create cultural assets which appeal not only to the locals but also to tourists and this will generate more convivial social interaction.  \r\n        \r\np=. +Before(left) and After(right) the creation of pedestrian malls in New York.+\r\n\r\n	<img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2009/02/27/opinion/27streettop.480.jpg\" width=\"250px\"  	height=\"300\"><img src=\"http://images.nymag.com/arts/architecture/features/timesquare120423_560.jpg\" width=\"250px\"  	height=\"300\">\r\n\r\np=. <img src=\"http://cfile240.uf.daum.net/image/1754D0414F19A91902991C\" width=\"px500\"  	height=\"55\">\r\n\r\np=.

For this reason, many people try to come up with the solution to the problem. Golf courses are one way to protect and can prevent elimination of habitats from urbanization. They are belonging to urban green spaces in a city that contains important ecological resources. So, golf industry considers correlation between environment and local communities.\r\n<img src=\"http://californiaoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/golfer-and-coots3.jpg\" width=\"300px\" height=\"200\"> \r\n\r\nRole of Golf Courses\r\n<a href=\" http://www.floridahabitat.org/wildlife-manual/golf-courses\"> Golf courses plays important role </a> for locals and nature that enjoy a golf game and offer habitats. They may preserve wildlife that is helping to save endangered species because golf courses are featured natural grasses, wetlands, trees, and plants which are fundamental factors for wildlife. Additionally, those small ingredients of habitats are equipped in golf courses that produce important food for small animals such as squirrels.These ecosystems enhance to appeal more natural environment and create better habitats. Another benefit of golf courses is that many plants and trees purify pollutants and absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.\r\n<img src=\"http://imavex.vo.llnwd.net/o18/clients/waucc/images/DSC00274.JPG\" width=\"250px\"  	height=\"200\"> <img src=\"http://www.greenvisions.ca/castlemore-pond1.jpeg\" width=\"250px\"  	height=\"200\"> \r\nGolf courses serve as important wildlife sanctuaries. As golf courses possess many trees, plants, and water, wild animals can search for food and inhabit or stay while migrating. It would be supplied nesting sites for many species of birds, for examples, the eastern bluebird, tree swallow, purple martin, red-cockaded woodpecker, and osprey. Following the case study, 183 ponds on 12 golf courses helped to reinforce food resources, shelters, and habitats for residents and migratory water birds. Improving golf courses in Lansing area is a future mission that conserves wildlife habitats within functional golf courses. A golf course can be potential efforts and will be a worth project for a community and wildlife habitats. \r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-04-24 17:53:25','2012-05-01 22:27:08',177,0,NULL,NULL),(216,'Transportation','Keeping the Michigan Avenue Corridor Safe',NULL,'h1.

The corridor facilitates a much needed revenue source as it allows members of the East Lansing community to travel to downtown efficiently. The most striking problem with the corridor is its extremely high injury rate due to vehicle collisions. One solution to such a problem is to add traffic calming measures. These allow for speed control that doesnt require much human interaction such as police for monitoring. However temporary police or camera monitoring is acceptable while measures are finalized.

A New Look for a Healthier Parking Lot \r\n\r\np. Everyday hundreds of people commute through Michigan Avenue. Although many changes have been made for the better, there is still more to be done. In most average cities, parking lots can take up a third of the total land area, becoming the single-most salient feature in the environment. This is exactly true for both Lansing communities as you travel down the Avenue.  Although some changes to the parking infrastructure have been made, more than just a tree and some wood chips need to be used. Landscaping parking lots along the Michigan Avenue would create a more attractive atmosphere, benefiting the health of the community and environment. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/arts/design/taking-parking-lots-seriously-as-public-spaces.html?pagewanted=all\">Paved, but Still Alive</a> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.monument-info-search.co.uk/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/blocks_image_5_1.png\" width=\"500px\"  	height=\"300\">\r\n\r\nh1. A Reduction in the Heat Island Effects Impact \r\n\r\np. One of the greatest affects of the incredible amounts of parking lots is heat island effect, as shown by the graph above. The vast expanse of paved surfaces contributes to heat island effect in two ways. First, is the accumulation of heat due to dark surfaces. According to Kathleen Wolf, “Black pavements have solar reflectance of 5 to 10 percent. Lighter pavements have solar reflectance rates of 25 percent or higher. Reflectance values for soils and various types of vegetation range from 5 to 45 percent.” <a href=\"http://www.naturewithin.info/Roadside/Trees_Parking_Green%20Law.pdf\">Trees, Parking and Green Law: Strategies for Sustainability</a>. Second, the low moisture content of the pavement does not allow the evaporation process to dissipate the sun’s heat. \r\n\r\nIntroducing more vegetative life to these parking lots along the Michigan Avenue could potentially reduce the overall temperature by a couple of degrees. Although, this all depends the overall amount of canopy cover produced and evaporation taking place within these parking lots. This leads some to believe that the cost would be far to great in order to see this temperature drop. But with the vegetation we have in parking lots today of course the change would be hard to see. Again, the temperature drop depends on how much canopy cover is produced along with how much evaporation takes place. These two things reduce the amount of exposed pavement that reduces the overall heat island effect. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://walmart-enviro.pbworks.com/f/1165375589/storm2.jpg\" width=\"400px\"  	height=\"550\">\r\n\r\nh1. A Reduction of Harmful Water Runoff \r\n\r\np. Another huge impact of these vast parking lots is the excessive water runoff created. Show in the chart above, urban runoff accounts for oil, gas, industrial waste, cleaning products, paints, and solvents. The impervious pavement creates a slide for this hazardous waste and sweeps it into local ponds, rivers, lakes, and in some terrible cases the drinking supply. On average the change from natural surfaces to impervious surfaces will generate 2 to 6 times more water runoff. This is terrible news for both the environment and local residents as local ecosystems are at a higher risk for hazardous water runoff. \r\n<a href=\"http://www.naturewithin.info/Roadside/Trees_Parking_Green%20Law.pdf\">Trees, Parking and Green Law: Strategies for Sustainability</a>\r\n\r\nBy landscaping vegetation and trees into parking lots we can greatly dampen the affects of water runoff. According to Kathleen Wolf, “trees can be used to reduce storm water runoff. Trees intercept a significant amount of rainfall in their canopies, where it evaporates and does not contact the ground” <a href=\"http://www.naturewithin.info/Roadside/Trees_Parking_Green%20Law.pdf\">Trees, Parking and Green Law: Strategies for Sustainability</a>. This would easily reduce the environmental impact of hazardous runoff in local rivers, ponds, and lakes. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.lawrencedubois.com/images/sacramento-skyline-daylight-lrg.jpg\" width=\"700px\"  	height=\"300\">\r\n\r\nh1. A Better Sacramento Area\r\n\r\np. Sacramento, California was one of the many areas that have taken action landscaping its local parking lots. “The utility department requires that the first 19 millimeters of runoff be retained on site for flood control and water-quality protection. A combination of vegetation and on-site infiltration basins proved to be an effective approach to reduce off-site transport of water. Approximately 50 percent of annual rainfall would be treated at reasonable cost ($ 0.83/m3 of runoff),” according again to Kathleen Wolf, <a href=\"http://www.naturewithin.info/Roadside/Trees_Parking_Green%20Law.pdf\">Trees, Parking and Green Law: Strategies for Sustainability</a>.\r\n \r\n<img src=\"http://www.brooksandrus.com/images/capitol_michigan_avenue_hdr.jpg\" width=\"500px\"  	height=\"250\">\r\n\r\nh1. For a Better Overall Lansing Area\r\n\r\np. Today’s landscaped parking lots along Michigan Avenue and throughout both Lansing and East Lansing are the bare minimum. If lucky there has been a hole cut in the pavement and a little tree has been placed there and usually that is not even the case. Landscaping the parking lots along Michigan Avenue and throughout would most importantly help the environment and the people living within the community, but it simply also helps the eye appeal for those who commute and live here everyday.

It also has the largest on-campus power plant in the United States. The T.B Simon power plant currently burns more than 200,000 tons of coal per year to create steam which in turn spins the generators that make electricity. With all of the coal that is being burned, there are tons and tons of harmful emissions being released into the air. Mostly greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrous oxide. These gases cause around 31 deaths per year in the Greater Lansing community. Now, the plant has tested the burning of biomass to create steam. At first thought, you would think that it would be better for the air and surrounding environment. But the burning of biomass was short lived because of the excess greenhouse gas that was being emitted. It was actually worse than coal. Michigan State student organizations such as Green Peace have stood up against the power plant and its operations, but no success has been made. The MSU Board of Trustees met to discuss how the school can rely on alternative sources of energy. These alternative sources include wind and solar power for the MSU campus. While 100% alternative energy is the goal, it isnt practical right now. The plan before the MSU Trustees would commit the university to increasing its reliance on alternative energy from its current two percent to 40 percent by 2030. But there is no reason why that cant start right now. There needs to be a decrease in the use of coal and a first installation of either wind turbines or solar panels. People just want to see an effort being made to start the switch to more sustainable and environmentally friendly sources of energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.wearepowershift.org/sites/wearepowershift.org/files/imagecache/blog_post_300/Michigan_State_Spartans_banner_051_0.jpg\" width=\"400px\"  	height=\"440\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://statenews.com/media/00/00/04/77/47773_jmm_new_powerplant1_011912f.jpg\" width=\"400px\"  	height=\"440\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://msubeyondcoal.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/dsc_0598.jpg\" width=\"400px\"  	height=\"440\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pp.msu.edu/index.cfm/power-and-water/\">T.B Simon Website</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.wearepowershift.org/blogs/shutting-down-michigan-state-university’s-coal-plant\">Learn more about shutting down MSUs power plant</a> \r\n\r\n<a href=\" http://michiganradio.org/post/michigan-state-university-trustees-expected-vote-energy-plan\">Michigan State University Trustees expected to vote on energy plan</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://michiganradio.org/post/michigan-state-university-commits-green-energy-not-enough-some\">Michigan State University commits to green energy (but not enough for some)</a>\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-04-24 21:57:15','2012-05-02 00:56:44',195,0,NULL,NULL),(225,'Cooperation','The Need For Jobs ',NULL,'     This picture, in my mind, says a lot.

This becomes an issue because he is no where ready to retire, but because many of the companies out there want \"new and fresh\" people to work for them rather than those who have been working their entire lives.  Job creation could help with this by making more jobs that people over 50 are eligible to do if something like this should happen to them.  \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2073520,00.html/\">Jobless People Stay Jobless</a> \r\n     As job searchers know, it is easier to find a job if you are currently working.

Programs may be referred to as tax abatements, tax subsidies, tax holidays, or tax reduction programs.  In New York, a statewide sales tax holiday was first enacted by the New York Legislature in 1996 and enabled the first tax-free week in January 1997. Currently, the initiative has been adopted by thirteen states. It commonly takes place as a form of tax-free weekend lasting Friday through Sunday.\r\nI think tax abatement is benefitial to *promote transactions* and *attract consumers* to shop. For example, in Florida, retailers mean that the spike in sales during the holiday do not appear to detract from sales before or after the holiday. This means that consumer spending is truly stimulating sales; it is not simply a case of people delaying or accelerating their purchases to take advantage of the tax-free status. For at least some retailers, this previously slow period has become their *third largest sales event* of the year-behind only the *Thanksgiving* and *Christmas weekends*. For more details: <a href=\"http://www.floridataxwatch.org/archive/taxholiday.html\">Sales Tax Holiday Provides Real Benefits to Consumers and Floridas Economy </a>  Sales tax abatement will be an efficient way to improve the economical situation in Greater Lansing.

Though they may ultimately be ineffective, they show that a city is *pro-business* and at least actively trying to spur economic development. The chances of their fading are slim and not likely to occur until a viable alternative emerges in their place. As long as one city offers them, others will follow suit in an attempt to remain competitive.\r\n\r\n ','http://media.navigatored.com/images/sales-tax-holidays-states.jpg',NULL,'Dispersion of Tax Abatement in United States',NULL,'2012-04-24 21:57:59','2012-05-02 22:57:27',197,1,NULL,NULL),(228,'Cooperation','Lifestyle centers cons',NULL,'<img src=\"http://blog.mlive.com/followthemoney/2007/10/large_Birkdale.jpg\" width=\"200px\"  	height=\"240\">\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-04-24 22:06:13','2012-04-24 22:06:13',224,0,NULL,NULL),(229,'Streetscape','Renovating the 127 Underpass; From Barrier to Gateway',NULL,'As many local East Lansing and Lansing residents have noticed, the U.S 127 overpass is quite the eye sore and sub-par in terms of pedestrian accessibility.  In order to make Lansing more appealing to students of MSU, the overpass must be transformed to look more like a gateway to opportunity for shopping and night-life, as well as an intellectually enriching experience visiting Michigan’s capital. In order to do so, the overpass must be transformed to be aesthetically pleasing. Ideally, my personal idea is to create an underpass filled with artwork; artwork that is inviting, modern, and easy on the eyes can be an attraction before the attraction, sort of like a visual appetizer before entering the main course that is Michigan Corridor. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://photocentric.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/treeportrait.jpg\"align=\"left\" width=\"180px\"\r\nheight=\"216\">There are many things that can be done to make renovating the underpass beneficial for the Lansing and East Lansing area. For one, student clubs and groups at MSU are always looking for ways to get involved in the community.  For example, ideally the recruitment of the art department or an art-based student organization to use the walls of underneath the overpass as canvas would give the department an opportunity to indulge artistically, and would benefit the Michigan Avenue Corridor cause. In addition to this, recruiting student groups cuts down the cost of hiring private companies to do renovations because clubs and groups are mostly service-project based.\r\n \r\n<img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7FcK3a2EHbk/Tm-lDs0hYTI/AAAAAAAAB5U/g55FD3BDMwI/s1600/danish-artist-paints-walls-in-istanbul.jpg\" width=\"200px\"  	height=\"240\">\r\nCreating an underpass that is welcoming is extremely important in increasing the amount of traffic that goes into downtown Lansing from East Lansing. Michigan State University currently has 15,000 bikes registered on campus, meaning in order to get these students to travel into the greater Lansing area we must make the underpass safer and more appealing. In addition, public art cultivates a greater culture that Lansing and East Lansing might be missing. <img src=\" http://dcist.com/attachments/dcist_sommer/2010_0218_takoma2.jpg\"width=\"200px\" height=\"240\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=http://chicago-outdoor-sculptures.blogspot.com/2009/11/living-2007.html/\">Public Art in Chicago\r\n<a href=http://www.streetartutopia.com/\">Street Art Utopia',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-04-24 22:07:35','2012-05-03 23:30:44',215,1,NULL,NULL),(230,'Dense Mixed Use','East Lansing Downtown Revitalization ',NULL,'h3.

He observes that “While the inviting, lively city can be a goal in itself, it is also the starting point for holistic city planning that encompasses the vital qualities that make a city safe, sustainable and healthy” (63). Michigan Avenue lacks livelihood, a sort of energy obtained through the interaction of people in its public spaces. In order to get people to use these public spaces, the necessity of expending pedestrian area stands out.\r\n\r\nh2.

In this case the pedestrian sidewalks must be well-lit/safe, the roads won’t be prone to traffic jams, and the attractions are more likely to increase. Current situation for Michigan Avenue Corridor is that pedestrian area is cut in pieces by roadway. This is still harmful for citizens to walk freely and would cause traffic jams during rush hours. Moreover, commercial stores, restaurants, coffee shops, monuments and public functions should be organized well along the pedestrian space to keep the crowd. If we can implement this plan properly, it would stimulate community engagement. These are the type of attractions that pedestrians should be taking their time to delve into while commuting to work or other places. We understand that people would like to get involved in activities, stand about or walk around traffic free area, interact with others, sit on benches, patios or in cafes. Pedestrian is the foundation that makes all of the activities possible. \r\n\r\nh3. Transparency\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.acecmi.org/2009awards/7.jpg\" width=\"250px\"  	height=\"300\">\r\nThe above picture presents the significant changes of Michigan Avenue Corridor:  patios outside the café, wider walkable area and more transparency of storefronts.\r\n\r\nTransparency is the aspect which can be focused on and one that can benefit from the collaboration of international and local communities. Transparency is whether the pedestrian can see the products or activities taking place behind the window of a certain shop or restaurant. These types of goods and activities can appeal towards the local and international communities to a certain degree.\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\nGehl, Jan. <a href=\" http://www.streetsblog.org/2011/06/14/jan-gehl-on-making-cities-safe-for-people/\">Cities For People</a> .

The greater Lansing area is a beautiful and amazing place to live and flourish, imagine the Lansing area cleaner and fresher than ever before. That is what an Electric CATA system can bring this wonderful city, and that is just what it will do.\r\n\r\nThe people who live in the Greater Lansing area know first-hand:\r\n\r\nThe city has so much potential and is bound for greatness. \r\n\r\nA great author, Mark Twain, once said, “Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines, sail away from the safe harbor, and catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.”\r\n\r\nThe world is changing at a dramatic rate, it’s only a matter of time before the era of natural gases and gasoline fuels as an energy source will be diminished. Why wait for the future, when you can begin the inevitable journey right now, here, in the greater Lansing area. \r\n\r\nh1. The inevitable facts are certain:\r\n\r\n1. A cleaner, friendlier environment is upon the Lansing area upon the introduction of the electric CATA system.\r\n\r\n2. The cost of implementing the system now will benefit the city as a whole in the long run.\r\n     * Electric buses are much more efficient than the average diesel combustion bus.\r\n     *  Thousands of dollars and gallons of diesel will be saved each and every year.\r\n     *  The overall help in saving the environment, and assisting the entire world in the fight against greenhouse gases will be substantial. \r\n\r\n3. A modern and unique system and society is upon the greater Lansing area that will help shape other cities not only across the county but across the world. \r\n\r\nh2. Reasons for change:\r\n\r\n * CATA operates off of 52% local funding, 26% state funding, and 22% off fares made by the company in revenue.\r\n * The cost to maintain the network is estimated to be $2.75 million per year, with maintenance occurring at a rate that prevents the need to ever completely replace the system. Which is overall cheaper in the long run compared to the current bus system. \r\n * Most importantly, the cost of oil has risen over the past two years, oil prices have climbed from $50 to nearly $100 a barrel.\r\n\r\nAn electric CATA system would not only lower spending costs on gas and oil but also lower the amount of poisonous emissions that are released into the atmosphere in the greater Lansing area, ultimately leading to a cleaner, friendlier environment. \r\n\r\nh4.

Many voters were unaware of the aspects that go into a bond, and what they should be looking for in the proposal.\r\n \r\n\r\nh1. Fiscal Responsibility \r\n\r\n The first main issue with choosing a bond is fiscal responsibility. The previous school bond had an extreme gap in this area. In total, the proposed plan would have spent 60 million dollars to bulldoze and reconstruct greater than 90% of each of five ELPS elementary school buildings. It would also have added a new wing to the middle school leaving East Lansing tax payers in debt for upwards of 40 years. In the upcoming elections look for a proposal that will spend money on only what needs to be improved for learning and safety purposes. Instead of bulldozing 90% of the five schools, improve on the existing structure if it is safe, rather then reconstructing from the ground up. By doing so  to save money. \r\n\r\nh2. Preservation of neighborhood schools\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.harrycutting.com/graphics/photos/education/kids-on-school-bus-IC5022-63.jpg\"width=\"200px\"height=\"240\" align=\"left\"> \r\nA “yes” vote on the last bond proposal would have allowed a $20M investment in two buildings less than .7 miles of each other. It also would have called for the closure of Red Cedar, a high performing, and fully enrolled neighborhood school. Despite having the largest increase in school aged children over the past decade, Spartan Village, the Flower Pot and Ivanhoe neighborhoods would be left without even one neighborhood school. When voting for a school board plan that ensures all children and neighborhoods are given the opportunity to have a school within equal walking distance.\r\n\r\nh3. Advancements in technology\r\n\r\nThe ELPS Bond proposes to build brand new computer laboratories in each of the new schools, but will not leave any money aside for advancements in technology for the years to come. In fact, the next chance for an update would most likely be when this bond ends and a new one can be achieved, which is assumed to be close to 2050. Another option would be to buy laptops for the students to use during their years in school. These laptops would be only used in school and must be replaced by the student if damaged. This would be less expensive and easier to update in future years as technology advances.\r\n\r\nAs with all decisions it is important to be informed when voting on the next school bond.

Example of an urban square </h4>\r\n\r\n*Campus Martius* is located in downtown Detroit and is a great example of a local urban square. It was created for the citys 300th anniversary and has been heavily utilized ever since. It boasts fountains, a large stage and a memorial for soldiers. In the winter, the middle fountain is transformed into an ice skating rink and has been a huge hit every year. Campus Martius has helped reshape and change the way people view Detroit.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/aerial_guardian_summer_rundell_assoc.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"350\">\r\nThis is the type of urban square envisioned for East Lansing but most likely on a much smaller scale.\r\n\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-04-24 22:20:29','2012-05-01 02:43:32',194,0,NULL,NULL),(239,'Streetscape','Organic Gardens: Healthy Lives, Healthy Community',NULL,'h1. *Organic Gardening: Healthy Lives, Healthy Community*\r\n\r\n<marquee behavior=\"slide\" direction=\"left\">\r\n<img src=\"http://www.clemson.edu/hort/comgardening/ComGard22.jpg\" width=\"400\" length=\"300\"><img src=\"http://simplehomemade.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/community-garden-boxes-and-sign.jpg\" width=\"400\" length=\"300\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3309/3305076150_7866e1655e.jpg\" width=\"400\" length=\"300\"><img src=\"http://beacheslocalfoodnetwork.web.officelive.com/images/garden%20shot2.jpg\" width=\"400\" length=\"300\">\r\n\r\n</marquee>\r\n\r\nh2.

The <a href=\"http://www.organicgardenproject.com/\"> idea </a> is to leave vacant land in Greater Lansing to local businesses and citizens for gardening organic vegetables, while also providing the option to sell.\r\n\r\np. The foundation of a good community is built around the citizens. Providing neighbors the opportunity to work together to help the community, their own health as well as the health of the environment and the economy will help build strong personal relationships and in turn a strong community. \r\n\r\nh2.

At the same time, we will provide healthy affordable food for one another while reducing stress through coping constructively with gardening. Gardening is proven to reduce blood pressure and muscle tension and promotes wonderful relaxation. Now picture this: having a place to "get away" from modern work stressors and technology that enables relaxation in the fresh outdoors, as opposed to being stuffed up inside.\r\n\r\nh2. Economy and Environment\r\n\r\n\r\np. Growing and selling produce locally will reduce the emissions released by transporting the produce that we buy now. The emissions are a leading cause for damage to the ozone which in turn results in what the world is struggling with today: global warming. By eliminating travel time and becoming independent producers of our own produce, we are enabling ourselves to go \"green\" and benefit our environment. Also by buying local produce we keep the income within Greater Lansing which will strengthen our citys economy. \r\n\r\nh2. Oppositions\r\n\r\n\r\np. The industrialized food system is more efficient because of use of pesticides and preservatives that prevent spoilage and food waste. While this is true, the organic vegetables that will be produced will not have to endure long travel times because they will be sold quickly after being harvested. This means that the preservatives that are used in the industrialized food system are unnecessary in this situation and food waste should not be of large concern. \r\n ',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-04-25 02:32:25','2012-05-01 20:48:47',187,0,NULL,NULL),(240,'Cooperation','Why Lansing Should Adopt the Community Policing Method',NULL,'The following image shows the 2010 crime rate index for the city of Lansing, Michigan.

According to this image, you are nearly four times more likely to be raped as a resident in Lansing, Michigan than any other state in the United States. This image statistically proves that government officials and the city of Lansing need to adopt the community policing method to ensure the safety of its’ 147 thousand+ residents.\r\n\r\nThe photo directly above illustrates the influence that the community polcing method has on a community. It allows residents within a community to trust law enforcement and allows them to see police as the \"friend\" rather than the \"enemy\". Community policing also allows members within the police department to interact and get to know residents on a more personal basis ultimately effecting the general qualtity of life in a positive manner.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/commp.pdf\">Community Policing Defined</a>  \r\nWith an increase in community policing, the city of Lansing would see an increase in trust with law enforcement and would empower people to work together to create solutions to problems within the city.  Giving citizens a “voice” within their community and having officers that are dedicated to listening would encourage individuals to give information to police that would otherwise go unheard. When residents and officers are partners, the result is more effective because it allows residents to have more control over the quality of life in their community.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.springfieldpolice.net/police/index.php?id=geographic\">Effective COP In Springfield</a>  \r\nThe Springfield Police Department uses Community Oriented Policing to reduce levels of crime, disorder, and fear within their city.

Community Oriented Policing has been proven effective in reducing crime and will continue in Springfield for years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrime is a continuous issue in Lansing.

Lansing is considered a food desert. What a food desert means is that people in the area have a lack of fresh and healthy food and cannot get the food easily and conveniently. To fix this problem it would be a good idea to build supermarkets and grocery stores around Lansing so they are accessible by everyone.\r\n<img src=\"http://img.timeinc.net/time/daily/2009/0905/food_desert_0522.jpg\"width=\"200px\"height=\"240\">\r\n\r\nh2.

The BRT is really different from a normal bus system because the buses and the whole system utilize technology that is used in light rail train systems to make the ride smoother and to allow it to carry more passengers. \r\n\r\nThe Bus Rapid Transit system would be very beneficial to the whole city of Lansing. The BRT is much faster and more efficient than the any other method of public transportation. And the BRT costs much less than any other method of transportation as well. The BRT would be perfect for the city of Lansing and it was worked very well in other cities as well.\r\n\r\n	The BRT is highly efficient, fast and reliable, but is it really right for Lansing? Well in 2005 Cleveland introduced the HealthLine as a part of their Euclid Corridor Project. The benefits were endless for the city of Cleveland and the community. Not only are citizens of the area able to travel much faster than the normal person, but around 5,000 new jobs were created to build and operate this new system.

Unity. Pieces of each of these “power towers” of the world are shown above, and each of which is known for having immense social success. Although this success can be credited to many factors, one in particular is the support given to the growing number of languages present in these communities. By embracing a sense of unity though a strong support and acceptance of the languages and cultures present along the Michigan Avenue Corridor and into greater Lansing, we too can create a city that is socially successful and within time, the city of Lansing can flourish.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. How can Lansing achieve such success through languages?\r\n * Simple support of the present languages\r\n * Education\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Losing the “all for one and one for all” mind frame\r\n\r\nThe reason for the success in many cities is partly because they stopped strictly supporting the use of English among everyone and started creating a community that supported all of the major languages present since after all, the one thing that literally brings communities together is in fact communication. \r\n<img src=\"http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/56743/56743,1204245628,5/stock-photo-bilingual-road-sign-welsh-english-9875662.jpg\" width=\"200px\" height=\"150\"> <img src=\"http://uefaeuro2012.lviv.ua/php_uploads/images/articleimages/ArticlePortletImage_11939.jpg\" width=\"300px\" height=\"200px\">\r\nAt the surprise of many, greater Lansing is home to many who call English their second language. Therefore, by supporting these languages in Lansing and along the Avenue by displaying <a href=\"http://www.progressive.org/mp/lantigua081108.html/\">multilingual</a> street signs, restaurant signs and menus, and traffic signs similarly as to what is seen above, Lansing would unite the community by allowing those of the minority languages to engage in the community and feel as though they belong.\r\n\r\nh3. Let’s start from the “get-go!”\r\n\r\nWhat better way to create a sense of unity within a community than by starting from the get-go when children are young and at their prime for retaining other languages.  Creating an <a href=\"http://www.gse.upenn.edu/~hornberg/papers/LanguageinSociety27%284%291998.pdf\">educational system</a> In Lansing to not only better the primary language of students but to also learn the basics of the other prominent languages in their community would help the children to grow up knowing not only a second language but possibly even a third, all in works to create a generation of Lansing that can unite and work together without dealing with barriers such as those of language.\r\nFor example, in the proceeding picture, children of South Africa are learning to speak French.\r\n<img src=\"http://wa1.www.unesco.org/uil/litbase/media/BurkinaFasoBEP.jpg\" width=\"400px\" height=\"220px\">\r\n\r\nh2.

Festivals will not only being residents together, but they will also increase the overall feel and create a truly happy and healthy population.  Since both the Greater Lansing and East Lansing have always been very creative and bursting with spectacular talent, we need to harness these talents and put them to good use.  By implementing festivals and events, this will unite the public and allow for residents to feel like they belong to a community and we can watch out city flourish like never before.  \r\n\r\nh2. *Why Implement More Festivals and Events?*\r\n\r\nThe benefits for implementing festivals in the Lansing area are endless.  \r\n * Festivals allow communities to partake in activities\r\n * Enhance community spirit\r\n * Promote community pride\r\n * Endorse togetherness\r\n * Celebrate the arts and our heritage\r\n * Stimulate the economy\r\n\r\nh2. *Arts Mean Business*\r\n\r\nThe festivals draw nearly half a million people to the Greater Lansing region over the course of the festival season.  All of the festivals combined provide 13.5 million dollars of economic impact for the region, and supports 80 to 100 direct jobs and nearly 400 indirect jobs according to the Arts Council of Greater Lansing. \r\n\r\nh2. *Bringing Communities Together*\r\n\r\nSince Michigan State University is conveniently located near Lansing, putting on festivals and events is a great way for both the longtime residents and the students to connect.  It is also a great opportunity to collaborate the works of professionals in Greater Lansing with the students at MSU.    \r\n\r\nh2. *Success Stories*\r\n\r\nOther towns have implemented festivals and their unity and profits are skyrocketing like never before.  During the summers in Caseville, Michigan, home to the Cheeseburger in Caseville Festival, surrounding stores are feeling the advantage of hosting the renowned festival.  Before this festival, Caseville was just a drive through town, now people book their hotels months in advance so they are able to experience the wacky festival.  When the first festival was put on, there was a mere 5,000 attendants, which has now blossomed into about 60,000 to 70,000 festivalgoers.  This event now makes up a good portion of Caseville’s stores and restaurant’s profits.  \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_VmLkgZ4mlE4/TG7xzGEpK8I/AAAAAAAACxc/twvzl2-Xd9s/s1600/Cheeseburger+5.jpg\" width=\"290px\" height=\"240\">\r\nCheeseburger in Caseville Festival\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the stats and impacts festivals have on other communities, why wouldnt Greater Lansing want to put festivals on the schedules for this summer?\r\n\r\nh2.

The four major arguments that give structure to this plan are: creating and developing parks in place of ruins, use new media to expand ideas throughout the community, to plant more trees and flower beds along the avenue to bring more value to the businesses, and to bring more people to the area by holding weekly events in the newly created parks to draw attention to the businesses of Lansing.

In the city of East Lansing this has become a problem. East Lansing is known for Michigan State University and from 2011 to 2012 MSU’s total enrollment is up approximately 2 percent to 47,800 students. With the large number of students that live both on and off campus it gets very crowded. The more congested it becomes the more injuries there are likely to be. This is where the creation of bike lanes gets its importance. Bike lanes create a protective barrier of parked cars, or trees, or at least a raised curb that help to separate vehicle traffic from cyclist traffic. <a href=\" http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/smart-takes/protected-bike-lanes-safer-than-street-study-confirms/14323 /\"> The Harvard School of Public Health </a> did a study that revealed “injuries were 28 percent lower on dedicated tracks versus on comparable roads without protected lanes.” Creating these bike lanes will help ensure the safety of people instead of relying on people to follow the “basic safety rules” of transportation.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/kqmz7W5ow5w\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\nThis video demonstrates that protected bike lanes have a positive impact in busy cities, like Chicago, and create a safe and organized environment for both motorists and bicyclists.\r\n\r\n+*Motorists vs. Bicyclists...*+\r\nWhen people encounter situations where the basic safety rules are not being followed this is where accidents and injuries happen. In 2010, <a href=\" http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/20/health/bicycle-injuries/index.html /\"> Michelle Matson</a> was hospitalized after a speeding driver, who failed to follow the proper safety rules, hit her on her bike and then proceeded to flee the scene. A bike lane in this incident could have protected Michelle Matson from harms way. Bike lanes in East Lansing will both improve the safety of cyclists and the flow of traffic and reduce the number of accidents that occur from bicycles and motor vehicles in East Lansing. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.siegel-lawfirm.com/uploads/Bicycle_Accident.jpg\" width=\"200px\"  	height=\"240\"> \r\nThis picture is intended to give a visual explanation of how dangerous biking can be when people decide not to follow the basic safety rules of bicyclists and motorists.\r\n\r\n+*For the Future...*+\r\nAs East Lansing continues to thrive and grow the risks of congested traffic need to be addressed.

It attracts tons of tourists and leads to the development of the city. And it was bided by 1.5 million Euro.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the district can deepen sense of community identity to make nonnative feel welcome and comfortable.

Why does East Lansing need a multicultural community district, not a cultural community district?\r\n\r\nAccording to <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/26/2646000.html/\">2010 US census of Lansing </a>,  it shows that there is a different percentage of Asian, Black, Hispanic in Lansing.  All these three percentage total 20.8 percentage of East Lansing population comes from minorities, which is proximately one fifth of the whole population of East Lansing. In Michigan State University that has over 50000 students, the international students from Asia, Europe and Africa are over 12 percentages of all the students. \r\n\r\nI believe having a multicultural area seems be necessary because of the increasing number of foreigners. Although East Lansing already has the ethnic areas for people to communicate, like International Centre and some Chinese restaurant, those places lack the celebration to be an individual’s culture and have very to offer tourists. \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore information about cultural district:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.city-data.com/neighborhood/Civic-Center-Bellingham-WA.html/\">Civic Center (Cultural District) neighborhood in Bellingham, Washington (WA)</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.cooltownstudios.com/site/the-difference-between-a-natural-cultural-district-and-a-corporate-cultural/\">The difference between a natural cultural district and a corporate cultural district</a>\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-04-26 18:05:07','2012-05-03 22:01:19',204,0,NULL,NULL),(254,'Cooperation','Can We Afford a Lifestyle Center?',NULL,'<img src=\"http://blog.mlive.com/followthemoney/2007/10/large_Birkdale.jpg\" width=\"200px\"  	height=\"240\">\r\nThe Lifestyle Center above looks lavish and sleek, but is it really worth the cost? Consider that in the photo above, the cars are leaving the center due to the bad weather. How often is Michigan known to have a bad weather? Well if you think back the weather went from the 70s back to the 50s, then down to 32 with snow and back up to 60 this past March. Id say thats pretty inconsistent. Lifestyle Centers are normally a wise idea for developing cities but the problem is finding a source of funds (investors, private companies, government) in a economically strained city such as, East Lansing. Also the ability of East Lansing to afford and substantially profit from such a center is greatly minimized considering the appropriate demographic for Lifestyle centers is very thin in East Lansing. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.cityofeastlansing.com/Home/Sites/EconomicDevelopment/CommunityRegionalOverview/QuickFacts/Lansing Demographics\">Difference of Demographics</a>\r\n\r\n  The wealthy and upperclass fuel the major customer base for Lifestyle centers due to the amount of high end luxury stores available at these centers. The median income in one residential town with a lifestyle center was 79,350, which happened to be roughly 27,000 dollars above the national average according to <a href=\"http://retailtrafficmag.com/news/lifestyle_centers_lessons_05172010/index.html\"> Elaine Misonzhnik</a> from Retail Traffic Magazine. If you click on the header above you can see that East Lansing citizens earn an average of 17,000 thousand dollars annually, which is 19 percent below the national average according to the link. The clash between the demographic needed and the demographic present in East Lansing illustrates that this location is not the best fit for a Lifestyle center.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.cityofeastlansing.com/budget/\"> Wheres the dough?</a>\r\n\r\nTake a look at the above analysis of the East Lansing city budget for the fiscal year of 2012-2013. Budget cuts, layoffs, and fiscal recession mark the cities financial sector. To obtain enough money to fund a lifestyle center would be almost impossible for the government. The estimated cost for just purchasing the land (or buying foreclosed buildings on site) would be 600,000 thousand dollars to more than a million dollars. Add the free Wi-Fi, which is said to cost 30,000 a year and the high end stores and the final cost would be a multi million dollar expenditure. Thats far too much of a strain for the city to absorb considering its already cutting its budget and laying off workers. The center would take 5 to 10 years to build  and the economy cant wait 10 years to see profit from a structure they put many millions of dollars in. \r\n\r\n *Is it worth it? \r\nIt would be wonderful to be able to afford such a center. With its aesthetic beauty and social atmosphere its an excellent structure for a rundown, regressing urban sprawl. The budget, however, cannot cooperate with the cost and the demographics of the city would not invite many investors or private companies to invest in such a project, because the city doesnt have the desired customer base to profit. Take into account that all Lifestyle centers are outlet shops and the Michigan weather, which is inconsistent and at time volatile and one can pretty much see that it would be harmful rather then helpful to the city of Lansing.        \r\n <img src=\"http://www.treadstonemortgage.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/fro-car.jpg\"width=\"200px\"  	height=\"240\">\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.treadstonemortgage.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/fro-car.\r\nhttp://blog.mlive.com/followthemoney/2007/10/large_Birkdale.\r\nhttp://money.cnn.com/2005/01/11/news/fortune500/retail_lifestylecenter/',NULL,NULL,'Picture from MLive.com ',NULL,'2012-04-26 19:00:54','2012-05-03 19:25:58',224,1,NULL,NULL),(256,'Business Development','It’s a Wire, It’s a Router.

The downfall is that the Red Cedar is polluted with runoff, trash, and at the end of the year filled with old rusty bikes.

Food deserts have been a problem in Lansing for the past few years and if not corrected could hurt not only the people of Lansing but also the economy.\r\n\r\nAlthough food deserts may sound like a difficult problem to fix they can be easily corrected with a few minor changes to the way Lansing distributes food. I’m a strong proponent of the use of farmers markets. I believe this is the first step toward eliminating distance and money restraints for people who are struggling in the greater Lansing area. The major areas that urban farming and farmers markets can help eliminate food deserts are in access to food retailers, availability of nutritious foods, or affordability of foods.\r\n\r\nLansing would not be the first to implement policies to help promote farmers markets. The City of New York has implemented several community-level initiatives such as increasing the number of farmers markets in underserved areas and increasing their use through the Health Bucks program. This program offers two dollar coupons for purchasing fresh fruits and vegetables at participating farmers markets. This program was intended to reduce barriers to access based on affordability. Through this program, EBT or debit card sales at farmers’ markets more than doubled from $89,000 in 2008 to over $220,000 in 2009. The program is being expanded into upstate New York as the Fresh Bucks program.\r\n<img src=\"http://www.center-trt.org/Images/HealthBucks.jpg\" width=\"200px\"  	height=\"240\">\r\n\r\nIf a healthy bucks program was introduced into the Lansing area it would bring a lot of attention to farmers markets.

Improving the connectivity of the city would have a huge positive impact on the city economically, environmentally, and in regards to physical health.\r\nThe changes can be made by increasing the amount of sidewalks and bike lanes in the city, making the new and existing walkways more attractive and safer, and by creating <a href=\"http://www.pps.org/reference/grplacefeat/\">people spaces</a> throughout the city.\r\n\r\n<H3>The Why</H3>\r\n\r\n*Impact on the City*\r\nMoving people out of their cars and onto the sidewalks will cause a lot more window shopping and an increase in activity throughout businesses downtown.  The migration from the motor ways to the people ways will make Lansing a far more lively and vibrant city with the hustle and bustle of people moving about. This unique connectivity will also make Lansing a prime spot for culture and art to be cultivated, creating events like the annual <a href=\"http://www.grbj.com/articles/74579-do-artists-make-money-during-artprize\">Grand Rapids ArtPrize</a>, and encouraging live street performances by bands and entertainers. This culture will make Lansing a more exciting city and environment to live in and be a large economic boost to the area businesses.\r\n\r\n*Healthy Living*\r\nWalking through Lansing will not only help the city to prosper, but it will also promote physical activity for people who would otherwise get very little in a typical work day and prevent Lansing from turning into a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1BQPV-iCkU\">WALL-E like dystopia</a> where people stop walking entirely. By creating convenient walkways to allow for greater walkability, Lansing residents could drastically increase their level of activity while decreasing their waistline. In addition to the physical health of Lansing residents and workers, the environment will be improved through the implementation of this reliable mode of transportation. Increasing pedestrian traffic will naturally decrease automobile traffic and reduce the harmful amounts of carbon dioxide and pollution in the air.

These walks need to be made safe from vehicular traffic and crime, as well as being made attractive and appealing so that they are used. To make the walks safer and more attractive, green medians should be built between the sidewalk and the road, and green call lights should be dispersed along the sidewalks like they are on MSU campus. In addition to sidewalks and bike lanes, creating large areas with benches, sculptures, and well landscaped plant life built around natural people spaces such as shopping centers or busy corners should also be added to the city.

This increasing competitiveness within our world has also trickled down into the development sector where many peoples first reaction towards improvement is to demolish and rebuild, but many have forgotten about a second option: redevelopment! Redevelopment is simply renewing or restoring on a site that has pre-existing uses and in reality the benefits are much greater to the overall cause than bringing in the bulldozers. \r\n\r\n<H2><font color=\"teal\">Why Redevelopment?</font></H2>\r\n\r\nRedevelopment promotes:\r\n\r\n1.Environmental consciousness\r\n2.Energy efficiency\r\n3.Social Equality\r\n4.Revitalization of traditions\r\n\r\n\r\nRedevelopment uses the already existing energy to create sustainable buildings which are not only environmentally\r\nfriendly,<img src=\"http://www.capitalgainsmedia.com/images/Development%20News%20Photos/Dev-Ino-Issues%2002/Dev-Ino%20Issue%200238/east-rehab-256-0067.jpg\" width=\"350px\"  	height=\"233\"align=\"right\"> but a sort of catalyst for change within a community.

However, between these attractions the rest of the trail is little more than a paved sidewalk similar to the one shown in the adjacent picture. I believe that the Lansing area could benefit in numerous ways from the installation of a new river walk tailored specifically to the wants of the community. By drawing ideas off of successful river walks from other cities, Lansings River Trail could become one of the most popular hotspots in town.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H1> Let the Community Congregate!</H1>\r\nThe citizens of Lansing need a place that is designated solely for their recreation. A place where live bands can come perform, where snowmen can be rolled in the winter, and a place that provides the perfect scenery for a group yoga class. While major cities have accomplished this through large plazas along their riverfront, I think an amphitheater with surrounding park space would be sufficient based on the size of the city. The amphitheater could serve as a host for everything from town hall meetings, to concerts, and possibly even the finish line for a marathon! The surrounding area would ideally have modern tables and chairs perfect for picnics or barbecues, while adding a touch of creativity. This space could be utilized over the weekends by small Lansing businesses such as restaurants, by brining out food carts and other stands and connecting with their customers in a whole new way. A set of public restrooms would give little excuse to run home on one those beautiful sunny afternoons that Michigan is famous for.\r\n\r\n<H1> For the Lads of Lansing </H1>\r\nThe Lansing area has been popular for young teens attending Michigan State University since our parents were up here partying (ages ago!). However with the serious tone The Capital sets its not a place many young people end up staying and raising their families. I think modernizing the facilities around the area would catch the eye of the younger creative class and implementing an area specifically for children would have this younger population thinking twice about possibly raising a family in the area.\r\n\r\n <img src=\"http://www.jjr-us.com/articles/1237/media/1094.jpg\" width=\"475px\"  	height=\"250\"><i> Detroits new <a href=\"http://www.detroitriverfront.org\">RiverFront</a> boasts many attractions for younger citizens including a carousel and a fountain that shoots water out of the ground. </i>  \r\n\r\nA play structure complete with slides, swings, and plenty of tubes to get lost in would provide hours of fun for Junior and a chance for mom to catch her breath.

It is a compromise between development now and a healthy world in the future, and unlike most large-scale movements, it can be achieved right here, right now, in Lansing. \r\n\r\n<H2>How can WE do THAT?</H2>\r\nThe community can achieve sustainable development by redeveloping the former Red Cedar Golf Course using the sustainable practices plan proposed by two local developers. \r\n\r\n<H2>Whats in it for us?</H2>\r\nThere is nothing that says \"Dont look at me\" more than abandoned, overgrown land right in the center of a city. Cities that no one wants to look at or visit are cities that become forgotten.  Unfortunately, the former Red Cedar Golf Course says just that for the Greater Lansing area.  However, sustainable development would fix this problem, and since it is a goal of many towns around the world, there is no better way for Greater Lansing to say \"Look at us!\" than by becoming a leading city for the movement. Sustainable Development has worked really well for similar cities, like <a href=\"http://www.virginia.edu/ien/docs/Chattanooga.pdf\r\n\">Chattanooga, Tennessee </a>, and the <a href=\"www.flatseast.com\r\n\">Flats East Bank</a> development in Cleveland.  If they can do it, so can we!\r\n \r\n<H1>The Plan</H1>\r\n	\r\nThe plan would\r\n\r\n  * Create restaurants, entertainment venues, and a hotel \r\n * Create student housing  \r\n * Extend the Lansing River Trail, shown below\r\n * Fix the storm drains to clean up the Red Cedar River\r\n * Create new green space and a park\r\n\r\nThe businesses would boost the economy of the Greater Lansing area and draw people in. Because of its accessibility from CATA routes and the River Trail, the area would have green transportation.  This would benefit the environment greatly, as well as business for the CATA company. Most importantly, residents of the area would have more recreational space and a place to have fun!

On the nearby MSU campus around half of the students own a bicycle due to the network of bike lanes MSU has implemented across campus.  However, even though Michigan Avenue runs across the north edge of campus it would be a rare occurrence to see a bicyclist along the road.  The few bicyclists you do see have to choose between riding in the road without even a shoulder to separate them from the cars rushing by or to ride on the sidewalk weaving in and out of crowds of pedestrians.  Bicyclists should have a right to travel along Michigan Avenue but currently they are not allowed the ease of access that cars and pedestrians have; by adding bike lanes along Michigan Avenue it would make it easier and safer to bike along Michigan Avenue and increase transportation diversity which studies, <a href=\"http://search.proquest.com.proxy1.cl.msu.edu/docview/881923272/13A31DFB9FE5C91A205/5?accountid=12598\">like this one of Broset, Norway</a>, have shown over and over again have many <a href=\"6.	http://michigancompletestreets.wordpress.com/resource/fact-sheets/\">positive effects</a> on the local community.

Furthermore the benefits far outweigh the cost of construction; it is likely the bike lane would end up paying for itself in only a few short years.  The cycling community is on the rise in Michigan with many new bike lanes already being added.  Saginaw Street just recently opened up a new bike lane (as seen in the pictures to the right), and even though it was a high traffic street and many worried that it would cause congestion, the project was a huge success.  The local community is happy with it and it even inspired an article on the <a href=\"http://michigancompletestreets.wordpress.com/resource/fact-sheets/\">Lancing City Pulse website</a>.  Bicycling is on the rise and because of the benefits it brings we need to encourage cycling and its growth as an economic, environmentally friendly, alternate form of transportation.

The concept was originally developed by Dr. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/SmiepKUUg0o?rel=0\">Robert Trojanowicz</a> who was the director of MSU National Center for Community Policing.

The new shops would need protection. In Westminster, California the Westminster Police Department developed the Police/Business Empowerment Partnership program which included additional hours of police patrol around the shopping centers. After this was implemented for a while, the shopper’s perception of safety increased as more patrol people were put on. Many small businesses are the victim of crimes because they barely have money for security. There has to be some security because small businesses are where many criminals start committing crimes. If a policy similar to this one was implemented in East Lansing, the stores around East Lansing would have better security.

There are many individual methods to tackle all of these problems but what if we could reduce these problems with one, quite simple, solution?\r\n\r\nh1.

Chicago is the U.S. \r\nleader in implementing Green Roof technology throughout a city.\r\n\r\nGreen Roof Technology is just the answer a city needs. Green roof technologies are able to solve many of the issues a city has, while creating a better more aesthetically pleasing <a href=\"http://www.seattle.gov/dpd/GreenBuilding/OurProgram/WhyBuildGreen/default.asp\">living and work environment</a>.\r\n\r\nh1. Breakdown of the Issues\r\n\r\nCities are plagued with many issues that can make them inefficient and unhealthy.\r\n\r\np(((. •	Cities have what is called a <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/heatisld/about/index.htm\r\n\">Heat Island Effect</a> which is when a city is warmer then the surrounding rural areas.\r\n\r\np(((. •	Greenhouse gases from the high density of cars also increase temperatures and decrease the air quality.\r\n\r\np(((. •	<a href=\" http://water.epa.gov/action/weatherchannel/stormwater.cfm\">Stormwater runoff</a> is a major issue within cities and pollutes our lakes and rivers.\r\n\r\nh1. How Do They Do It?\r\n\r\np(((. •	Green roofs can reduce the temperature in multiple ways. First they reduce the amount of dark, flat surfaces that would normally absorb heat. Green roofs also cool cities with what is called <a href=\"http://www.greenroofs.com/content/energy_editor003.htm\">evapotranspiration</a>.\r\n\r\np(((. •	Plants absorb greenhouse gases, mainly Carbon Dioxide, and release oxygen <a href=\" http://livingroofs.org/2010030775/green-roof-benefits/airqual.html \">improving air quality</a> .\r\n\r\np(((. •	The plants absorb most of the rain water and release it through evaporation before it reaches the streets below. Any water that make it to the streets are filtered and don’t pick up harmful chemicals that are normally present on a normal roof.\r\n\r\nh1. Lansing and the World\r\n\r\nGreen Roof Technologies have many advantages that would help improve greater Lansing, but lack of research on a city wide level creates doubt. There is <a href=\"http://www.hrt.msu.edu/greenroof/\">research</a> already being conducted at Michigan State University on a small scale, but perhaps if MSU, being a large university and very into eco-friendly solutions would implement and research advantages on a city wide scale it would continue and grow and spread to the heart of Lansing.\r\n\r\nCountries in Europe are seeing the greatest growth in green roofs. Germany is among the leaders in pushing for green roof technologies; 12% of roofs throughout the country are green roofs. <a href=\"http://www.thesolutionsjournal.com/node/981\">Germany</a> sets a great example of what reforms can do to help promote green roofs and other sustainable resources.\r\n<img src=\"http://www.thesolutionsjournal.com/sites/default/files/Fea_Germany_Figure4.jpg\" width=\"300px\"  	height=\"240\">\r\nMulti-use center in Berlin, Germany that uses green roofs to improve energy efficiency and stormwater management.','http://fotos.starmedia.com/imagenes/2012/08/nyc_1.jpg',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-12-04 20:34:36','2012-12-09 19:05:59',241,1,NULL,NULL),(274,'Transportation','Multimodal Complete Streets for a Higher Quality of Life',NULL,'<img src=\"http://www.brooksandrus.com/images/capitol_michigan_avenue_hdr.jpg\" width=\"400px\"height=\"300\">\r\n\r\nh2. Benefits of a Multimodal Complete Street\r\n\r\nEven though Michigan Avenue is an important street that connects the campus of Michigan State University, downtown East Lansing, and downtown Lansing, it is not complete. In the Greater Lansing Area, it is clear personal vehicles dominate this street. If Michigan Avenue became a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_streets\">complete street</a> it would be more bus, bicyclist, and walker friendly. Citizens in the area would become healthier, happier, save money in the long run, and local economies would thrive.\r\n\r\nh3. Healthier Citizens\r\n\r\nObesity is a major issue in the United States with 28 percent of Americans being classified as clinically obese. A large reason for the increase in overweight Americans is inactivity. People do not walk and bike enough because cities and roads, at present, are accessible only to automobiles. If Michigan Avenue became a complete street it would be more walker and bicyclist friendly, and the potential improvement in the health of citizens living along the avenue would be dramatic. For more information on the health benefits of complete streets, check out this <a href=\"http://marc.org/transportation/completestreets/Livable-Streets-health-benefits-flier.pdf\">PDF</a> from the Mid-America Regional Council.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/rs6sj.jpg\" width=\"500px\"height=\"400\">\r\nThe above chart illustrates that as the percent of people that walk, bike, or take transit increases, the percent of people that are obese decreases.\r\n\r\nh3. Happier Citizens\r\n\r\nA significant number of current residents along Michigan Avenue have no viable means of getting around. Many disadvantaged groups (ie., the elderly, poor, children and adolescents) who are not allowed or able to drive are not well served by the present condition of Michigan Avenue. Allowing other means of transportation will give these groups access to  jobs, healthy food, health care, recreation, and social interaction that they are currently denied. This increased access will lead to increased satisfaction and happiness for all groups.\r\n\r\nh3. Save Money\r\n\r\nMaking Michigan Avenue a complete street would be a worthwhile investment. Both local citizens and local governments would save a substantial amount of money in the long run. The total savings of citizens from biking, walking, or taking transit instead of driving can really add up across a city. For example, Chicago residents have saved $2.3 billion from making the switch. Local governments would also benefit by having lower annual road maintenance costs and reduced costs of treating pedestrians harmed in auto crashes since less people would be driving and streets would be safer.

Thriving Economy\r\n\r\nAreas with complete streets have more thriving economies.  Complete streets stimulate local economies by increasing bike and foot traffic which leads to increased sales for nearby businesses. They also spur private investment by attracting new businesses and jobs to the area. In addition, neighborhoods with complete streets have higher property values due to their bike paths and increased walkability.

Currently, it is dominated mainly by cars and motorized vehicles.  Often, the quality of a city is measured by its livability and walkability.  People want to live and visit a city that has a strong sense of community, where every person can be a part of the social environment.<h2>Walkability</h2><img src=\"http://www.spada.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/boring-street.jpg\" width=\"250\" hspace=\"5\" align=\"right\">Strong communities usually have many people outside walking around; they have people that walk to work and to the store instead of driving everywhere.  However, the greater Lansing area is not known for being extremely walker friendly.  Pedestrians would be much more likely to walk along the sidewalks if there are more trees in the area.  Trees increase the visual quality of the streets adding to the satisfaction of pedestrians.  Areas without vegetation are often boring and do not have any people walking about and interacting.  They also add safety for both the pedestrians and the cars by framing the road providing a better visual frame of the road to drivers.<h2>Impact on the environment</h2>With the growing problem of global warming, trees and plants also absorb carbon dioxide and reduce the effect of the vehicles on the atmosphere.  <a href=\"http://www.uvm.edu/~cfcm/UCF/MSU_casestudy_02022012.pdf\">Michigan State University</a> conducted a study proving how much trees on campus have reduce the amount of pollution in the air.  <a href=\"http://www.lansingmi.gov/forestry/index.jsp\">Lansing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cityofeastlansing.com/UrbanForestry/\">East Lansing</a> already have programs in place to increase the number of trees, but those programs are not widely known or recognized.<br><br>In order to control the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, reduce the number of traffic accidents, and increase the number of pedestrians, the city of Lansing should plant trees along the sidewalks of Michigan Avenue.\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:100; font-size:80%; text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http://www.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/12_03/houston_trees.jpg\">Sidewalk trees encourage people to walk instead of driving.</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-12-04 20:36:53','2012-12-10 20:51:01',251,1,NULL,NULL),(276,'Streetscape','Not Just A Street',NULL,'The Project for Public Spaces has said that, “ if you plan for cities for cars and traffic, you get cars and traffic.

Expert Steve Nyx even offers <a href=http://forestry.about.com/od/urbanforestry/tp/street_trees.htm>suggestions</a> on which trees would be most beneficial to the economy and the general environment so not too much resources would be wasted if the plan was implemented.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.mattawanmi.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Hedge-Maple.jpg\" width=\"250px\"  	height=\"165\"> <img src=\"http://www.arborday.org/trees/graphics/trees/detail/Thornless-Honeylocust_1.jpg\" width=\"229px\"  	height=\"250\">\r\nThe Hedge Maple (as pictured on the left) is one of the many trees Steve Nyx listed as benefiting to the streets because of its tolerance to pests, dry soil, air pollutants, and diseases. Pictured on the right is the Thornless Honeylocust, another plant Steve Nyx listed as beneficial due to its ability to create a beautiful lawn because the leaves change golden yellow right before they fall thus blending in with the ground under it.\r\n\r\nOther examples may include::\r\n<ul><li>the European Hornbeam, useful for its sturdy wood as a hedge, screen, or windbreak.</li>\r\n<li>the Princeton Sentry Maidenhair Tree, convenient because of its strong resistances to storms, ability to make shade, and the fact that its pest-free.</li>\r\n<li>the Bur Oak, a tree tolerant of low-quality soil, can adapt to anything making it useful should an area with lots of space need some decoration.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>How would this affect the community as a whole?</h2>\r\nDoing so would help increase the amount of pedestrians that feel safe walking along the roads and just how safe drivers feel on the roads because trees provide the sense of narrowed streets. The <a href=http://www.sustainablecitiesinstitute.org/view/page.basic/class/feature.class/Lesson_Benefits_Urb_Forest_Trees>Sustainable Cities Institute</a> states that by doing so, a barrier will be created between vehicles and pedestrians.\r\n\r\nAs for environmental benefits, trees reduce stormwater runoff, urban heat-island effect, erosion (perhaps even eliminating it), improve air quality, and promote biodiversity.\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Reducing stormwater runoff will help filter pollutants since trees can capture large amounts of rain through their root systems and canopies thus altering the path so the rain will be added to the groundwater supply.</li>\r\n<li>More trees will help to provide shade and by doing so, heat wont be trapped as much therefore reducing the temperature of the surrounding area.</li>\r\n<li>Tree roots will bind to the soil.

Here in Greater Lansing, residents, MSU students, and city officials believe the time has come to install a system of citywide Wi-Fi.

Background Information\r\n\r\nThe Lansing area is struggling economically because of the poor economy in the state of Michigan. The cities are desperately trying to find new ways to improve their economies. Along with the economy, the area has always focused greatly on the environment. Because of this, the cities possess <a href=\"http://www.lansingmi.gov/gogreen/index.jsp\">many initiatives</a> to promote environmental sustainability. Part of this focus is on the Red Cedar River, a main river that flows about 51 miles through East Lansing and Lansing.\r\n<img src=\"http://media.mlive.com/lansing-news/photo/10772717-large.jpeg\" width=\"300px\"height=\"300\">\r\nThis river is thought to be polluted and devoid of life. In fact, the river is currently being greatly polluted by a defective drain on the site of the old Red Cedar Golf Course. People in the nearby cities do not use it for recreational purposes, but it serves as a major aspect of the environment in the area. Due to its struggling economy and focus on the environment, the Lansing area produces many ideas whose goals are to benefit the economy and the environment of the cities simultaneously. An example of a plan like this is the Capital Gateway Plan.\r\n\r\nh3<. Capital Gateway Plan\r\n\r\nIn the Lansing area, a plan is currently being studied that aims to benefit the environment and economy. It proposes to do so by developing the currently abandoned area of the Red Cedar Golf Course. The main proponents of this plan are to:\r\n * Improve the conditions of the Red Cedar River\r\n * Create a recreational and entertainment park\r\n * Establish housing for Michigan State University students\r\n * Establish townhouses and apartments for other citizens\r\n * Build business areas with restaurants and shopping centers\r\n \r\nThe link to the actual document of the plan can be found <a href=\"http://www.purelansing.com/documents/Jerome%20&%20Ferguson%20Proposal.pdf\">here</a>.\r\nThe following picture shows the layout for what the plan aims to develop in the area of the old golf course.\r\n<img src=\"http://eastlansinginfo.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/Jerome%20and%20Ferguson%20proposal%20image.jpg\" width=\"350px\"height=\"350\">\r\nBased on the large size of the park area in the image and the many areas with potential to stimulate the economy, it is easy to see that the plan has well rounded proponents that aim to benefit the Lansing area.\r\n\r\nh3<. Why should it be implemented?\r\n\r\nThe Capital Gateway Plan is an idea that was created to help both environmental and economic issues in the Lansing area. It should be enacted because it has great potential to benefit the cities.\r\n * It aims to benefit the environment by improving the conditions of the Red Cedar, which is very important to the overall environment in the area.\r\n * It also plans to benefit the environment along with the morale of the cities by creating a recreational park for people to interact and enjoy nature.\r\n * It means to benefit the economy by building an entertainment park (a facility for concerts, movies, and other performances), housing areas, restaurants, and shopping centers. These provide the economy of the cities with stimulus.\r\n\r\nAn example of a similar plan that is currently beneficial for the area is the <a href=\"http://www.sanantonioriver.org/proj_benefits/benefits.php\">San Antonio River Improvements Project</a>.\r\n\r\n*Disadvantages?*\r\n\r\nThere are definitely some potential downsides, like initial cost and construction time to the Capital Gateway Plan.

With the presence of Michigan State University, a substantial argument has been made for making attempts to retain the creative class long after graduation in both Lansing and East Lansing, increasing economic development and putting East Lansing on the map as a city people really want to live in. Bringing them to the city would mean planning more cultural events, making the city user-friendly and pleasing to the eye, and attracting companies that hold creative workers.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"http://theideafeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/sans-titre-1.gif\"></center>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.creativeclass.com/\">Creative Class Group</a>, made up of academics who agree with Floridas plans, have worked with clients ranging from the United States Government to MIT to Microsoft.

Traffic calming involves using the simple laws of physics (like the raised crosswalk pictured above, which acts as a speed bump) to slow drivers down.\r\n\r\nh3. Benefits of a Traffic Calming Plan\r\n * Roads will be much less dangerous because cars will be forced to travel at safe speeds.\r\n * The number of accidents will be greatly reduced.\r\n * Pedestrians and drivers alike will feel better about being out and about in the city.\r\n * Areas near major streets will be less noisy because of the reduced speeds, creating a better living environment.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.talgov.com/pubworks/pubworks-traffic-calming.aspx\">This traffic calming plan in Tallahasse, Florida</a> will give you a good idea of the steps involved in a general traffic calming plan.

East Lansings Green Movement\r\n\r\nThe green movement has finally become justifiable and the benefits of building green are growing in awareness. East Lansing can continue building on its newly established <a href=\"http://www.cityofeastlansing.com/Home/Departments/Communications/MediaRoom/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/121/East-Lansing-Adopts-Groundbreaking-Green-Building-Policy/\">green building policy</a> by increasing public awareness and hiring <a href=\" https://new.usgbc.org/leed\"> LEED</a> designers in order to jump start the process.\r\n\r\nh1. What is Green Building?\r\n\r\n According to the National Assembly of Home Builders, green building is \"incorporating environmental considerations and resource efficiency into every step of the building and land development process to minimize environmental impact”. \r\n\r\n\r\nh1.   Keeping it Green: The Environment Side of Green Building      \r\n\r\nThe main goal of building green is to reduce the environmental impact of the structure. Components of lowering the environmental impact include:\r\n                                         * reduces commercial waste and pollution\r\n                                         * limits carbon emission\r\n                                         * reduces water and electricity usage\r\n                                                                         \r\n\r\nh1.  Lets Talk Business: Making More Green \r\n  \r\nGreen building not only helps the environment, but also helps businesses attract costumers and reduces costs. On a percentage basis, the return on investment in LEED certified buildings is ten times the initial cost due to lower maintenance costs and utility bills. On top of the greater return on investment, the state and federal governments provide significant building incentives for green building. This will attract more companies to invest in East Lansing and will overall boost the greater Lansing areas economy and population. In addition, the unique, quirky, and modern design of the building or structure in itself will attract customers because of the consumer perception that if the firm spends time to make their building visually and emotionally attractive then their product must also be appealing and thought out. In addition, these offices, stores, and parking garages will produce a comfortable working environment and will increase employee efficiency because of the advance technology and modern tone of the buildings. This will make the employees jobs less stressful and will allow more effort to be placed on the customer.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.okland-const.com/images/Papago001.jpg\"  width=\"200px\" height=\"240\">\r\n\r\n_East Lansing can implement creative ideas such as those used in office buildings like this one in Tempe, Arizona, which was built with a double-skin louver system providing substantial shade and a highly efficient cooling system. Green technology and design significantly lowers costs compared to a traditional commercial building._\r\n\r\nh1.  Got Green?: The Social and Educational Benefits\r\n\r\nIn order to make Green Building efficient and appealing, it must positively affect all aspects of society including. Social and Education aspects of building green include:\r\n * Provides a comfortable and modern networking environment\r\n * The buildings provide a model for future projects inside and out of the city and state\r\n * Visually carries on and promotes Michigan State Universitys green motto which creates more of a unity between the campus and city\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.inhabitat.com/wp-content/uploads/leedgarage1.jpg\" width=\"200px\" height=\"150\">\r\n\r\n_LEED certified buildings and structures such as this parking garage in Santa Monica, California, looks modern and quirky in a way that attracts people and promotes conversation._',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-12-04 21:09:29','2012-12-10 05:11:37',246,8,NULL,NULL),(286,'Business Development','Private Sector Growth?',NULL,'<table width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"12\" border=\"0\">\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\">\r\n\r\n<p><br><img src=\"http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/michigan/files/201207/Lansing%2520autolaep%2520052.jpg\" width=\"210px\"height=\"255\"></p>\r\n<p><small><i>A cyclist rides on what was formerly a thriving GM plant.

Stop! What is Traffic Calming?\r\n\r\nCrossing a street would be incredibly easy if there were no cars, but at the same time, getting rid of the cars would defeat the purpose of the road in the first place. Our next best option to make East Lansing more “pedestrian friendly” falls on a little something called <a href=\"http://trafficcalming.org/definition//\">traffic calming</a>. Traffic calming devices’ one and only goal in life is to slow down the speed of oncoming traffic. These <a href=\"http://www.vtpi.org/tdm/tdm4.htm/\">obstacles</a>  come in all shapes and sizes including: speed humps, traffic circles, raised medians, roundabouts, diverters, and rumble strips. (Speed hump seen below and traffic circle in consecutive photograph)\r\n\r\n<img src=\" https://brentwood-tn.org/Modules/ShowImage.aspx?imageid=1201\" width=\"450px\"  	height=\"270\">\r\n\r\nh2. Caution. Why is Traffic Calming Important?\r\n\r\nEast Lansing houses an environment where finding Waldo sounds easier than scouting out a parking spot. Even though this is true, pedestrians still make up a majority of the East Lansing campus. A rather wide array of walking pathways can be considered main highways for the large student population and other persons belonging to the no-car department. Creating a space where vehicular and non-vehicular transportation can coexist peacefully benefits the community as a whole. This is where traffic-calming measures come into play.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.shieldsgardens.com/Blogs/Garden/Traffic_Circle_in_Carmel_0041_m.jpg\" width=\"500px\"  	height=\"300\">\r\n\r\nh2. Benefits of Traffic Calming Ahead.\r\n\r\nDecreasing the speed of traffic is not the one and only benefit that traffic calming can mark down on its resume. Along with this, traffic calming measures have added <a href=\"http://trafficlogix.com/en/trafficcalming/trafficcalming#tctab_benefits/\">perks</a>  such as:\r\n\r\n *  Decreasing the rate of accidents by a maximum percentage of 56.7%.\r\n\r\n * Creating a safer environment for both pedestrians and bikers.\r\n\r\n * Improving the aesthetics of the road by adding greenery and artistic structures (as seen in previous photograph of traffic circle)\r\n \r\n * Increasing health benefits for the community due to increased walkability causing an increase in physical exercise\r\n\r\n * Reducing car usage and therefore inducing a drop in energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission\r\n \r\n * As mentioned previously, reducing the speed of traffic on average 3 mph.\r\n\r\nEast Lansing has already installed three traffic circles into the area and the results have been positive as seen in this <a href=\"http://www.ite.org/traffic/documents/JIA94A40.pdf\r\n/\">East Lansing article</a> \r\n More can be done to improve the city through restructuring the roads with traffic calming measures with the allotted budget.

The outdated Michigan Avenue Corridor is in need of a transformation into an up to date, environment-friendly infrastructure suitable for attracting new businesses that desire to thrive in East Lansing. Anybody who has passed the vacant land off of Michigan Avenue that used to be occupied by the Red Cedar Golf Course can see that it has tremendous potential to be turned into something special. I believe that a green lifestyle center including landmarks such as fountains constructed on the location of the former Red Cedar Golf Course will provide the social interactivity required to attract new business that the area has lacked for so many years.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.eastlansinginfo.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/golf%20course%20project%20through%20fence.jpg\" width=\"500px\" height=\"350\">\r\n_Undeveloped land formerly occupied by the Red Cedar Golf Course._\r\n\r\nh1. Why?\r\n\r\n*1. Attracting New Business*\r\n\r\np(. As a result of the corridor transformation into an attractive green lifestyle center where community members gather to socialize, entrepreneurs will be attracted to the area and new businesses will sprout along Michigan Avenue. A <a href=\"http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/recreational_planning/documents/voppreface.pdf\">2007 Virginia Outdoors Plan</a> explains that parks and open spaces, similar to what would be implemented, attract new businesses and residents because of how they heighten the quality of life present in the community. New businesses spawning in close proximity to the redeveloped corridor and the green lifestyle center will only enhance the mystique and overall quality of life of the area for all of its residents.\r\n\r\n*2. Promoting Students Sense of Community*\r\n\r\np(. What specifically about a green lifestyle center in the form of a park and general open space will attract the creative students of Michigan State University to socialize in the area? The idea of “greening” the corridor perfectly corresponds with the demographic of college students in the area who are loyal to the “green” movement. Implementing green working spaces to the already discussed green social, lifestyle center in the form of the outdoor park, this proposal is strong in that its versatility allows for many different types of interactions, both socially and educationally, between all different types of people in the community.\r\n\r\nh2. Models of Success in Similar Development\r\n\r\np. With big ideas of what the Michigan Avenue Corridor could become in terms of a green lifestyle center and beyond, it is important to compare with and draw ideas from different cities that have worked to accomplish the same goals.\r\n\r\n*1. Hong Kong*\r\n\r\np(. Greater Lansing could benefit their ideas by studying techniques used in Hong Kong, a place with very limited space that needs to be used to its fullest potential. In <a href=\"http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/%28ASCE%29UP.1943-5444.0000076\">Hong Kong</a>, city planners used different strategies to optimize the layout of green spaces, including the use of green roofs. Although East Lansing cannot be classified as a compact urban area to the equal degree of Hong Kong, brainstorming with use of ideas executed in Hong Kong may spark innovative ideas that could turn the corridor’s green lifestyle center into a unique, unparalleled experience.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://mattovermatter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/green_roof.jpg\" width=\"600px\" height=\"350\">\r\n_Well-utilized roof space in the form of green park development._\r\n\r\n*2. Chicagos Millennium Park*\r\n\r\np(. It would also be beneficial to study the green experience the city of Chicago set out to create with <a href=\"https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/crp384/2008reports/12Millennium_Park.pdf\">Millennium Park</a> when they transformed a train yard in one corner of the park into a massive green space possessing many innovative amenities and progressive ideas in order to characterize the heart and soul of Chicagos downtown. Since this green space was developed, the economic benefits of its construction have been absolutely astounding and stand to be productive for years to come, especially within a 2 block radius of the park.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbndzdyaQL1qfqfdyo1_500.jpg\" width=\"600px\" height=\"350\">\r\n_Millennium Park in Chicago, Illinois._\r\n\r\nh3. Concerns Regarding Cost\r\n\r\np. As many of you have already imagined, the cost of a project like this is the main concern. Even the main proponent, <a href=\"http://www.eastlansinginfo.org/content/jerome-responds-questions-golf-course-redevelopment\">Chris Jerome</a>, of an existing plan, the Jerome-Ferguson Proposal, to transform the former Red Cedar Golf Course into a green park and redevelopment project admits that there will be a substantially greater risk to East Lansing taxpayers as a result of his plan for development being implemented.\r\n\r\np.

These antennas, in turn, are connected to the Internet. Depending on its location, each antenna can provide a coverage area with a radius of about 1,000ft. I estimated East Lansing needing about 400 antennas to cover the city. Though this might be pricy, the establishment of a municipal wifi network would eventually be paid off through monthly usage fees and would definitely be a worthwhile investment for our city. \r\n\r\nBefore making a decision to go through with this plan or not, the advantages and disadvantages must be analyzed very carefully. Though there are some disadvantages, I believe that this is a good idea that would open countless doors for communication.\r\n\r\n\r\nimages courtesy of:\r\nhttp://stonemountainlodge.com/\r\nhttp://www.ltidata.com/technologies/secure/index.html\r\nhttp://www.thefullwiki.org/Wi-Fi',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-12-09 22:00:16','2012-12-09 22:51:41',257,0,NULL,NULL),(290,'Streetscape','Making Sidewalks More Attractive',NULL,'As a result of using a car the majority of the time, sidewalks have been neglected.

In the first year of the traffic-free area, there was a thirty five percent increase in the number of pedestrians.  \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/04/22/travel/copenhagen-600.jpg\" width=\"200px\" height=\"240\">\r\n\r\nAside from Copenhagen being used to walk and shop, it developed to the point where there are jazz festivals, theater festivals, concerts, parades, and carnivals.  Not only was the pedestrian street successful, it was thriving.  Between 1968 and 1986 pedestrian traffic increased by twenty-five percent.  “All available squares of good quality were filled to capacity everyday, as were all available outdoor cafes and benches,” (A Changing Street Life in a Changing Society 14). \r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2013-04-22 14:59:04','2013-04-24 05:59:23',269,0,NULL,NULL),(291,'Transportation','All Aboard in the Motor City ',NULL,'One can make many comparisons about the similarities between Lansing and Detroit; in particular, their public transportation situations. Detroit, without a doubt, identifies as the “Motor City” capital of the world. The combination of railway and automobiles allows the city to experience a period of economic growth, increased opportunity for jobs, and allows for drastic expansion within the city.  With the expansion of this light rail system (M1 rail) down Woodward Ave and beyond, it will allow more human traffic to flow into the city, stimulate the economy, encourage development within the city, increase the level of opportunity for residents, increase safety, and help reduce the environmental impacts cars generate.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://detroittraining.com/wp-content/uploads/C4161870821.jpg  \" width=\"200px\"  	height=\"200\">\r\n \r\n\r\nFor more information on the initial project, click here: \r\n\r\n	<a href=\"http://www.m-1rail.com/about/ \">M1 Railway Site</a> \r\n\r\n\r\nh1. Safety \r\n\r\nStatistically speaking, one could argue that railway systems present a much safer option than the everyday use of automobiles.  If more people utilize the M1 rail system due to its increased outreach, death and injury due to automobile traffic would drastically decrease.\r\n\r\n\r\nh1. Economic Benefits\r\n\r\nAs more people travel throughout the city, more and more shops will receive attention from potential customers that would never have visited if they traveled to it in an automobile. As illustrated below, the human traffic into shops in areas surrounding the M1 system will be at an all-time high. The increase in sales will ultimately feed back into the city and cause further economic growth including a decrease in unemployment. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/579191/thumbs/s-M1-RAIL-large.jpg \" width=\"200px\"  	height=\"200\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh1. Environmental Benefits\r\n\r\n Public transportation, or more specifically, public railway systems, reduces the amount of carbon emissions released by automotive use within cities today.  If more people utilized a public train, less people would drive and therefore decrease the production of greenhouse gases. \r\n\r\n\r\nh1. Social Impact \r\n\r\n Clearly, the implementation of a large-scale light rail system will act as a link between social groups, which will improve the unity and image of the city of Detroit as a whole..  A successful city identifies as one whole unit; the city and suburbs act as one. This way, the economy can grow, the city becomes safe, the environment of the city becomes self-cleansing, and the opportunity for employment and schooling becomes equal for all residents.  Racial tension will cease to exist and the city leaders and residents act in harmony to promote the well being of the city. \r\n\r\nInterested?

Why Should We Care?\r\n\r\n Walkability within a city motivates the residents of the community to become more active and want to spend more time outside. Making a city more walkable also refers to putting cars in their place and advocating for safe streets and lowered speed limits. Having exceptional sidewalks are also a key component in having a city function greatly; pedestrians do not like to walk or run on cracked sidewalks or sidewalks they feel as if they could be hurt on. Great cities are made to enhance the people that live within it, and what better way to do that than providing exceptional sidewalks for pedestrians and bikers, providing safe streets, and ways for them to better themselves, while helping the economy and helping the community come together as one. By setting up and creating more walkability in the Lansing area, there would be a greater sense of connection with the city and the people. The “walkability” quality of a city is one that is very important and is needed in order for that city to function properly.  The Greater Lansing area would do well if they took into account how many successful communities and cities depend on walkability and take some ideas from that. \r\n\r\n\r\nWalkability in a city has so many positive effects on a city that could take it to the next level, which could definitely be a step in the right direction for the Greater Lansing area.

There are many things that make a city prosper; an active community, dedicated government, and a growing economy. Although it is not easy designing a 21st century city, there are many different things that can be done. Bike lanes are a cost-efficient way to improve the quality of a city while also adding other benefits. Installing a bike lane on Michigan Avenue between downtown Lansing and Grand River Ave would add numerous benefits to our States capital and add a connection to the home of MSUs great campus.\r\n\r\n*Benefits of bike lanes*;\r\n- Health benefits for citizens; reduced obesity and diabetes rates\r\n- Reduction in noise and air pollution\r\n- Saves money (for the city and citizens)\r\n- Increased rate of safety for current bikers\r\n- <a href=\"http://www.roaddiet.org/benefits.html\">Other important benefits </a>\r\n\r\n*Building onto the current infrastructure*\r\nAdding this bike lane will not only encourage new bikers to join the revolution, but also cause current bikers on MSU campus to utilize the amenities of downtown Lansing through this corridor.

Factors that affect the price include the need to repaint or remove traffic lines, adjust road size, and change signals and other factors. Considering Mayor Virg Bernero included $3.3 million in funding for road and sidewalk repair in his <a href=\"http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2013/03/lansing_mayor_virg_bernero_to_4.html\">2014 budget proposal</a>  for Lansing, this would be a small fraction of the budget that would payoff for the city big time.\r\n\r\n*Connecting communities for a stronger future*\r\nThis bike lane would add to the fragmented stretches of bike lanes already available to Lansing and East Lansing residents. The two communities would then be connected in a way that would begin to build a strong bike infrastructure in both cities (but more specifically Lansing). This would also help create a community of utilitarian bikers which would add to the sustainability of Lansing and East Lansing as cities.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://favim.com/orig/201105/03/Favim.com-32768.jpg\" width=\"400px\"  	height=\"260\">\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2013-04-22 15:06:19','2013-05-02 00:27:36',273,2,NULL,NULL),(300,'Streetscape','Walkability from East Lansing to Boulder',NULL,'Michigan Avenue has great potential to be a great source of walkability for students and residents alike.

This would save residents money on their energy bills which would assist the local economy\r\nNot only can trees save residents money, they also bring economic significance to the land that they are on, raising property values. “If you plant a tree today on the west side of your home, in 5 years your energy bills should be 3% less. In 15 years the savings will be nearly 12%.” (Dr. E. Greg McPherson, Center for Urban Forest Research) \r\nRubber sidewalks would help to improve the housing crisis, by letting trees grow on property that is near or right next to sidewalks. “Landscaping, especially with trees, can increase property values as much as 20 percent.” (Management Information Services/ICMA).

Each panel of sidewalk equals one tire rescued from a landfill” Every single tire that we use from the landfill decreases the volume of waste that we need to bury in the ground using space that we can’t afford to use. “Accumulations of wornout automobile tires create fire and health hazards” (Eldin).

People also save money switching from cars to taking public transit or walking or biking. In fact people in Cleveland, Ohio have saved $9,576 annually. That’s money that can be put back into the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://thecityfix.com/files/2009/05/livable-streets.jpg\" width=\"200px\" height=\"240\">\r\n\r\n*Health Rewards*\r\nComplete streets can lead to health benefits for people. Reports showed that 43 percent of people with safe places to walk within 19 minutes of home met levels of daily activity recommended by the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention. This can become possible with Complete Streets.\r\n\r\n*Reduce green house gases*\r\nComplete Streets reduce the emission of green house gases. For example, if one switches to public transit, it can cut out 20 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions that can add up to 4,800 pounds in a year. In 2001, the National Household Transportation Survey found that nearly 50 percent of all trips in city areas were three miles or less. They also found that 28 percent of trips were one mile or less. What was most shocking was that automobiles were used to make 65 percent of these one-mile trips. If cities were to have Complete Streets, people would be able to walk or take a bus and help preserve the environment. To see how much greenhouse gases cars and other forms of transportation produce,  look at the graph below.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.deakin.edu.au/travelsmart/images/greenhouse.jpg\" width=\"200px\" height=\"240\">\r\n\r\n\r\n*It has been done before*\r\nCities in Michigan have started to adopt complete streets policies.

There are numerous solutions that can be done in the Lansing area to make the sidewalks safer for the citizens. Typically the city will do root maintenance to fix the sidewalks, which involves redoing the broken parts of the sidewalk. Today there is a new method that uses rubber panels. It is able to provide the same function as concrete but is less forgiving and can flex as tree roots grow beneath, rather than crack apart. These will make the city have less maintenance on the sidewalks, and will also make it more enjoyable for pedestrians to walk on a smooth surface. There are now various types of rubber sidewalks that could be used around the Lansing area. \r\n\r\n•<a href=\"http://terrecon.com/products/rubbersidewalks//\">The Original Non-Concrete Solution - Rubbersidewalk</a> \r\n•<a href=\"http://terrecon.com/products/terrewalks//\">Maximum Cost Savings -Terrewalk</a> \r\n•<a href=\"http://terrecon.com/products/verlayo//\">Thinner Version Used Over Existing Flooring - Verlayo</a> \r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/w9i2oUZjWss\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<h1>Cost</h1>\r\n The estimated cost to buy and install every square meter of rubber sidewalk is about $250, while standard concrete sidewalk only costs $150. Rubber sidewalks cost more because they usually require some more preparation in soft soil areas, but they are often ready to use much faster than concrete. Also rubber sidewalks have a much longer life span than concrete, and require much less maintenance.<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3108/3163916828_1e1ce3c6ba.jpg  \" width=\"500px\"  	height=\"240\"> The manufacture’s website,      <a href=\"http://terrecon.com//\">Terrecon,</a>  has additional information that can be found about rubber sidewalks. Since Michigan State University is typically the type of campus where the students want to walk from place to place, then the addition of rubber sidewalks will not only accommodate this need, but it will create a better environment for everyone. Also walkability in the Lansing area can be improved through other methods that do not even require touching sidewalks. There are various ways of changing road signs, and adding cameras that can make it safer for seniors and cause motorists to reduce their speed. Improving walkability will always be a necessity around the area, but it will turn Lansing into more than just a city; it will be a place that people will love to be around.','http://www.turfdesignbuild.com/content/LC/img/2008/07/LC200807_69.jpg ',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2013-04-22 15:27:13','2013-05-02 10:45:50',274,2,NULL,NULL),(308,'Transportation','Walkability in Lansing',NULL,'What is Walkability?  \r\nWalkability is a measure of not only how accessible a city is for pedestrians, but is also about the atmosphere that a city provides for its citizens.  Safety, efficiency, and desirability are also factors in determining how walkable a city is.  It is just as much about how many people *want* to walk around the city, as it is about pedestrians having the *ability* to walk around the city.  Walkability can be improved by having sidewalks, bike lanes, and alternative transportation.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i-cdn.apartmenttherapy.com/uimages/la/011210_walk01.jpg\" width=\"450px\"  	height=\"240\">\r\n\r\nWhy is Walkability Important?\r\nWalkability is important because if it is implemented effectively the benefits include improved property values, public health, and local economy, as well as helping the environment.  It is estimated that having a walkable city can raise property values up to $34,000, which will raise Lansings dwindling property values.  Lansing already has a basic level of walkability, but there is room for improvement. \r\n\r\n*+Lansing’s Strengths and Weaknesses:+*\r\n\r\nLansing’s Strengths are:\r\n * Residential areas are close to commercial areas\r\n * A strong bus system with <a href=\"http://www.cata.org/AboutCATA/InsideCATA/CATAFacts/tabid/151/Default.aspx\">CATA</a> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/green.autoblog.com/media/2007/07/cataawardbanner.jpg\" width=\"450px\"  	height=\"240\">\r\n\r\nLansing’s weaknesses are\r\n * Poor infrastructure, especially in low income areas.

Roadways need to be shared equally by everyone who uses them, and must be safe for all.\r\n * Infrastructure involves improving pedestrian safety by placing more paved bike and walking paths around the city.  Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero is spending $3.3 million on <a href=\"http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2013303250015\">infrastructure repair</a>, including $200,000 specifically for sidewalks.   \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/ithaca.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/2c/82c683ea-4a01-11e2-9a56-0019bb2963f4/50d1f96b4e4cc.image.jpg\" width=\"450px\"  	height=\"240\">\r\n\r\nWalkability brings many advantages to a city, including increased property values, improvements to the environment, improving the local economy, and increased physical activity.

Grand River becomes very congested when vehicles stop and go with traffic lights, crossing pedestrians and bicyclists.  When this congestion happens not only does it become unsafe, but it becomes very inefficient to travel on.  The largest problem with traffic are the cross walks.  Cars have stop for crossing bicyclists and pedestrians, making Grand River congested and dangerous.  A solution to this problem has been built on Monmouth University on route 71.  Route 71 is a busy road like Grand River Ave.  Monmouth University’s problem was crosswalks were interfering with passing vehicles.  Their solution to this problem was to build a pedestrian tunnel underneath of route 71.\r\n<img src=\"http://paradigm21planning.com/Periodic_Table_Pages/Monmouth_University_Ped_Tunnel.jpg\" width=\"250px\"height=\"240\">  \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.tunnelit.net/pedestrian_tunnels.shtml\">Pedestrian Tunnel</a>\r\n_*Benefits*_\r\nBuilding this tunnel allowed pedestrians to not only safely cross, but to do it without stopping traffic, “Since the construction of the tunnel there have not been any pedestrian and vehicular conflicts” (Katana.edu).

Biking 20 miles a week, can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by fifty percent! \r\n\r\nSave money- The average household spends $7,179 per year on owning and driving their cars. This amount can be drastically cut by cycling instead of driving for everything. With less driving, less oil is needed which would decrease the amount we import and would drive down the price while also saving you money. \r\n\r\nSave roads- Another thing that will benefit Lansing is that the use of bicycles cut down on driving which helps put less wear on our roads. With the use of bicycles we cut down on the amount of cars being driven, thus saving wear and tear and money spent on the roads. We can relocate the time and money to other areas where it would be more useful and beneficial. \r\n\r\nValue- Bike paths are a valuable commodity, in a study on the Burke-Gilman trail in Washington; homes near the trail sell for an average higher price of 6 percent. These trails can also help sell houses and are viewed as an economic asset during the real estate process. Also there is less crime in the area surrounding these trails.

Reducing this can save money and the environment in Greater Lansing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSolutions\r\n\r\nSmall Scale: \r\n-	By every American family replacing one single light bulb with an energy efficient bulb we would save enough energy to light 3 million homes for a year, save about $600 million in annual energy costs, and prevent 9 billion pounds of greenhouse gas emissions per year.  These changes in Lansing can include, but are not limited to, driving smaller engine vehicles, turning off lights when not in use, traveling less, growing local gardens, riding public transportation, walking, and eating foods in season. \r\nCommunity Scale: \r\n-	Solar energy conducts the suns radiation, a process without any smoke, gas, or other chemical by-product.  A process that is also virtually infinite so long as there is sunlight.  It also does not require ongoing raw materials like oil or coal, both of which are used to generate electricity. <a href=\"http://exploringgreentechnology.com/solar-energy/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-solar-energy/\">Advantages and disadvantages of solar energy.</a>   Using dormant and unused area space on roofs may be effective as well, seeing as Lansing has an abundance of roof tops.
