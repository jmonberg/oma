Linking Lansing & U addresses a problem the city has faced for years: the disconnect between thousands of students in the area – the brightest and most promising future leaders in the local community.\r\n\r\nLauren has served on the board of this freshly-founded organization since August of 2008. This year, their largest project was a collaboration with Lansing for the 24th annual Silver Bells in the City event. They managed to transport more than 500 students from MSU campus to the event in downtown Lansing. The festive busses were decorated and played music en route from three designated “Silver Stops” on campus down to the Capitol. “We just wanted to get more MSU kids down there and it ended up being a really good turnout,” Lauren said. “Silver Bells was a really big thing because we started from scratch and this was the first year that the student group Linking Lansing & U was around.”\r\n\r\nLauren expressed major interest in the Michigan Avenue Corridor Project. \r\n“MSU is kind of separate from stuff that’s going on in Lansing. I think it’d be really awesome if there were more groups. I feel like we were kind of lost, like, ‘Where are we going to start?’ because it’s such a big thing.” Lauren comments that there is more to Lansing than the stereotype many MSU students have applied. “I think the art and culture areas are really beneficial - I don’t think a lot of people know they’re really down there.” Art fairs, festivals, and restaurants fill the streets throughout the year and a very important portion of the community is unaware.\r\n\r\nFor more information on Linking Lansing & U, please visit: \r\nhttp://www.lansingmi.gov/invest/linking_lansing_and_u/index.jsp\r\n\r\n(MSU’s student group’s site is expected to be up and running in April.)\r\n','2009-03-26 00:00:37','2009-03-26 00:33:39',NULL,'MSU','elderain',10,NULL,NULL,NULL),(11,'Scott Harris - Everybody Reads: Books and Stuff','!http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3438/3386661596_778f7c5e51.jpg?v=0!\r\n\r\nSay hello to Scott Harris, owner of Everybody Reads: Books and Stuff located on Lansing’s west side.  Everybody reads is connected to the Gone Wired Café on East Michigan Avenue making it easy to find a nice book and read it in the comfort of the coffee shop.  But Everybody Reads is not just a bookstore.  It is a community resource center that holds events as diverse as poetry readings and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.  \r\n\r\nThe idea of a bookstore that Scott and his wife shared became a reality when Scott was substitute teaching in Lansing.  A student grieving his father’s death was in class just a day after the memorial service and Scott comforted the student due to similar experiences Scott had encountered.  After this interaction it became clear to Scott that these children and all other underrepresented individuals need a place to find resources so they know they are not alone.  \r\n\r\nThe book selections at Everybody Reads are deliberate in that they provide a place for the underrepresented to gain resources and to connect with others.  “When you walk in the store you’re not going to see all the Best Sellers,” Scott says.  “Instead, you’ll find books for people going through chemo-therapy, for children in single-parent households, for the disabled, for the environment, or L.G.B.T. [Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender] studies.”\r\n\r\nNot only do the books and events at Everybody Reads attempt to appeal to all walks of life, but the atmosphere also makes these varying communities feel comfortable.  Scott says that he attempts to greet every person that walks in the store and in doing so conversations become inevitable.  \r\n\r\nEverybody Reads: Books and Stuff\r\n2019 East Michigan Avenue \r\nLansing, MI 48912\r\nwww.becauseeverybodyreads.com\r\n','2009-03-26 02:20:40','2009-03-26 23:22:44','www.becauseeverybodyreads.com','Lansing Eastside','Joseph M.',11,NULL,NULL,NULL),(12,'Music Loving MSU Student','<table class=\"image styled\" \r\nalign=\"right\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5em\"\r\ncellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n<caption align=\"bottom\">Colleen Carlisle Poses in Front of a Favorite Spot on the Corridor: Macs Bar<br><br></caption>\r\n<tr><td><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3539/3439564063_aeea291df3.jpg?v=0\"><img title=\"Colleen Carlisle at Macs Bar\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3539/3439564063_aeea291df3.jpg?v=0\" \r\nalt=\"ALTERNATE TEXT\" align=\"right\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\"  /></a></td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<big><big><big>C</big></big></big>olleen Carlisle is a freshman at Michigan State University, majoring in Advertising. She is a music enthusiast and regularly frequents Macs Bar on the Michigan Avenue Corridor to attend shows by both DJs and local and touring bands. \"I like to go to Macs because the shows are for people 18 and up, unlike many bars in the area which require you to be 21. Macs is also a great place because the shows are inexpensive, so for the price Id pay to see a band at a larger venue I can see four or five times as many shows at Macs.\" \r\n\r\nColleen also enjoys getting a late bite to eat with friends at Theios after shows, or sampling the Thai buffet at Lamais Kitchen any time of day. \"The buffet at Lamais is awesome. Im a vegetarian and Im never disappointed. Theres always something new and delicious to try. Its a great deal for students too.\" She mentioned though, that she probably frequents the Corridor more than most freshmen at MSU. She has two older sisters who both attend the University and quickly introduced her to a few great spots on the Corridor. Although she says without that introduction she probably would not have known much about the area. Many Corridor businesses do not advertise events in the residence halls. \"Sometimes I look for upcoming events in the Noise and the City Pulse, but I still dont know much about the Corridor past Gone Wired Cafe.\" \r\n\r\nColleen expressed interest in the proposed changes for the Michigan Avenue Corridor Project, and said that she would like to see other students discovering its hidden gems. \"Id love more places where I could sit outside with friends. It would be great to see more people walking around the Corridor to run their errands instead of by car, and really enjoying the area. Thats one thing thats great about East Lansing; when youre downtown you dont really need a car. It would be great if that was extended to the Corridor.\" \r\n\r\nColleen mentioned that more effective advertising to students, especially about events like 18 and up shows, might entice more student traffic. Information about inexpensive places to eat and shop, and even Lansing community events and festivals would encourage her friends to consider making the walk or taking the bus to the Corridor. Colleen said that before she graduates from Michigan State University, she would like to see the Corridor progress into an exciting place that is an essential part of students lives, as well as a place she will visit long after graduation.  \r\n','2009-03-26 23:17:58','2009-04-15 16:38:18',NULL,'Michigan State University','Steph Carlisle',9,NULL,NULL,NULL),(13,'Great Place for Children Grow up','Dave Muylle—owner and neighborhood builder—believes that neighborhoods on Michigan Avenue are a great place for children to grow up.

Run-down gas stations, dilapidated buildings and miles of cornfields don’t do much for the eye—or for the economy, for that matter. Several times a month, Ashley takes Highway 127 to and from her hometown of Chesaning, a village about an hour north of East Lansing. As a Junior in the midst of Michigan State University’s grueling pre-med program, she enjoys escaping the clutches of studying and exams from time to time. The problem is, the drive from Michigan Avenue to 127 is so drab that she often feels depressed or sleepy by the time she hits the highway.\r\n\r\n!http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3609/3388961830_9d08e4887a.jpg?v=0!\r\n<small>Ashley B</small>\r\n\r\nKnown by her friends as rational and down-to-earth, Ashley realizes that the state of Michigan’s economy most likely indicates that nothing extravagant will soon be taking up residence along the Corridor. “I would just like to see <b>some sort of infrastructure</b> on that stretch,” Ashley says. “So many cars go through there. I don’t know why there aren’t any businesses. Maybe a new food joint, something we don’t have around here—like Popeyes or Sonic!” Her blue eyes cloud as she recounts a particular incident involving the Corridor: “I was on my way home one time around dusk. I was a minute or two from 127 when three deer suddenly ran across the road in front of me. I had to stomp on my brakes and veer to the side to avoid smashing into them. Luckily, no other cars were behind me or next to me, or else there probably would have been an accident.” She feels that if there were more businesses along this stretch of Michigan Avenue, deer would not be so compelled to run out into traffic. \r\n\r\nLike most students her age, Ashley is extremely comfortable using the Internet. “A <b>website</b> for this project is <b>definitely the best way to reach out to the younger community</b>,” she says. “I’m not sure if the whole thing affects me enough to where I would use the website a lot. Maybe I would if I knew that the website would tell us what specific improvements are going to be made along the Corridor.” Laughing, Ashley whispers the secret to motivate students into using the project’s website: “Prizes.” \r\n\r\nMany MSU students interact with Michigan Avenue in much the same way that Ashley does—briefly. The fact of the matter is <b>many students want a change in scenery</b>. The Corridor begins in East Lansing, Michigan’s most populated college town, and ends in Lansing, Michigan’s Capital City. Yet between these two cities lies a stretch of land that is anything but significant. Shouldn’t East Lansing and Lansing be linked by something special, something that meets the standards of the outlying cities?

The store was founded by two women in 2005 and located in their house on Fairview Street.  It was moved to the current location in 2007, sold to a second owner, and that is where Melanie found it for sale while purchasing beads one day.  She has owned the store since August 2008 and continues to expand beyond the large stock of sparkling <i>Swarovski crystal</i>, pearls and silver into a variety of other natural products.  As the “new kid on the block” she has felt very welcome to the area and likes her neighbors and the eclectic crowd that frequents the block.  She feels it is a good location for her store.</p>  \r\n\r\n  <p>Her shop provides services above and beyond regular purchases of beads.  She helps with designs and assembly of special order gifts and weddings.  A special shelf is dedicated to local school colors where students can design their own jewelry in support of their team.  Design suggestions and assembly techniques are found on a turning shelf and if you don’t have time to design your own jewelry she has small kits that make the whole process very simple.  A few local jewelry artists display and sell their art in her store as well, so if you don’t have time to create your own designs you can stop by and chose a completed piece.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>As the economy took a down-turn Melanie noticed that sales decreased on the  more expensive items in her stock and has since expanded into more natural products and less expensive metals.  Such products include:  bone, horn, clay, wood, glass, pewter and copper.  The products are selling well and she has hundreds of designs and colors to choose from.  She offers <u>discounts</u> to MSU students and Sparrow hospital employees and hopes to include State of Michigan employees in her discount program soon.  Along with a variety of weekly specials and punch cards, these discounts and quality products allow Melanie flexibility of product and increasing sales.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Before leaving the store customers must pass by the gumball machine on the countertop.  Looking closely they will notice it’s not gumballs inside, but beads!  Melanie’s grandmother gave each grandchild a gumball machine from a previous business venture and Melanie didn’t know quite what to do with it until one day when one of her relatives said **“Hey, use that as a bead dispenser”.**  She decided it would be a novel idea and filled it with mixed glass beads.  Customers love to put a quarter into the machine and leave with a handful of beads.  It’s a bargain!</p>\r\n','2009-03-30 14:19:00','2009-04-14 12:59:16',NULL,'2015 E. Michigan Ave.','gardner',15,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17,'New Urbanism','This is an assingnment from my class in relation to the Michigan Avenue Corridor.\r\n\r\nBy Sean Thomas\r\n\r\nThe group that I am part of is improving streetscape and landscape features an order to identify and distinguish the corridor as a destination, encourage pedestrian circulation, and support a vibrant urban experience. As a member of this group, the two topics I did research on are recycling bins and trolleys for the Michigan Avenue Corridor project. The reason I chose recycling bins was simply because I had the notion that if recycling bins for plastic, aluminum and paper were added to the street, it would help keep city environment clean, and to help citizens become more environmentally conscious.  My other topic was trolleys. I did research on this and thought some new city transportation could be added, and it would start with Michigan Avenue. And like the recycling bins, it will provide a benefit for the local environment. \r\n\r\nRecycling Bins\r\n	Recycling bins on the city sidewalks would be clever. In New York City for example, many of their streets have multiple recycling bins. One recycling bin is for aluminum containers. Another is for plastic containers. And, there are even bins for newspapers and magazines. If somebody is done reading a newspaper, they can recycle it instead of throwing in the garbage or on the street. City officials in New York have reported that these bins have helped decrease the littering rates in the city. IN 2006, it was reported that 1.7 million tons of recyclables were collected.\r\n	These bins are green and blue. Blue represents cans, and green represents paper. 25,000 street corners in New York City have these green and blue bins. If this idea were to be adopted for the Michigan Avenue Corridor project, it could become benefit for the Lansing area. Michigan Avenue would be the guinea pig. The bins could be placed on all of the street corners that are on the street. Once the city sees how this works, they will most likely be impressed, and decide to add them to the rest of the city corners. Lansing is not much to look at these days. However, that doesn’t mean it can’t be restored. It all starts with thinking green. Once the public becomes more environmentally conscious, the city will look cleaner and have a more positive image. \r\n	Another example of recycling bins is in the city of Toronto. They have recycling bins all over the city as well. But most of the city’s bins are located throughout parks and forestry area. Besides keeping the city clean, they try to keep their parks clean as well. This goes to show that recycling bins can also be used in many recreational areas. For Michigan Avenue, not only could the street corners have these bins, but recreational areas can have them as well. Once the city sees how the recycling bins have benefited the city streets, it will do the same thing for parks and recreational areas.\r\n\r\nTrolleys\r\n	The other topic I did research on was trolleys. In many cities such as Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Toronto, and Washington DC, there is a significant city transportation; trolleys. Trolleys are a lot like subway cars; only they run through the streets instead of underground. Now, we already have the Cata Buses as our transportation. However, trolleys can provide more benefits than a bus. One thing is for sure; they provide a more economic benefit because they run on electricity instead of gas. Like the recycling bins, Michigan Avenue can be used as a guinea pig for another experiment. If this idea were to be adapted and successful, the rest of the city could see a better future for city transportation. \r\n	There would be some issues that would occur. If this were to happen, the city would have to be careful on their spending because city dollars must be spent to add a rail system. They can become dangerous for pedestrians. If they were to be added in the street, then cyclists would not be able to use the street due to the risks of accidents. They can also be difficult to operate in mixed traffic, and could cause delayed disruptions in their lanes. One of the biggest issues that can occur is noise. The steel wheels produce a rather obnoxious noise, and it would not be a surprise to see citizens becoming displeased with the noise. \r\n	Despite these issues, there are also some pros. They have much bigger capacity rate than buses. This is convenient because it will get more people to their destination on time, whereas with a bus, only so many people can fit. Since they run on batteries, they can be recharged, and this beats going to the pump because gas prices are always changing and draining money out of people’s pockets. The operating costs are also lower, and the vehicles run more efficiently. Unlike buses, trolleys give cities a more positive image than a negative image that is seen from city buses. This will help give Lansing and its community a more positive image about the city. And since they are more visible, it is easy for riders to know where routes are, so this will help people who get lost when navigating through the city. And another benefit is that they are great for passengers who are having rush hour. Instead of being stuck in a car waiting for traffic to move, all they need is 75 cents to ride the trolley, and will not have to worry about being stuck in traffic. This will prevent rush hour traffic once people start taking the trolley. \r\n	I have included some sources that give more information one each topic. One is an article related to the blue and green bins in New York. The other is a website that talks about living in Toronto, and their recycling system in their city parks. The other is a government website for Scottsdale, AZ and it talks about how the city has adapted to the trolley system. Finally, my other source is the Philly Trolley website, which talks about the history of trolley cars and is provided with pictures and a historical time line. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSources\r\n\r\nThese sites give more information on cities that have adapted the use of trolleys and recycling bins.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/oct2008/2008-10-27-093.asp\r\nhttp://www.toronto.ca/parks/wastediversion/media-coverage.htm\r\nhttp://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/trolley.asp\r\nhttp://www.phillytrolley.org/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2009-03-30 18:01:27','2009-03-30 18:01:27',NULL,'Michigan Avenue','sean',17,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18,'Corie Jason','!http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3452/3400153140_6990a29ffc_m.jpg!\r\n  <p>**<big>Corie Jason</big>** is a community leader who is <u>making a difference</u>, not only by her actions but by her attitude as well.  After living in the area as an anthropology student, she decided to return to the same area to raise a family.

It contains progressive people that are evoking changes in the area.</p>  \r\n  <p>Through her involvement as the president of the Board of Directors at <i>Allen Neighborhood Center</i> and leader of her community **Prospect Protectors**, she has heard of the Michigan Avenue Corridor Project.  She feels that it is still “under the radar” of the local residents but some of the community leaders and businesses are aware of the project and feel positive towards it.  She senses it may be difficult to put back into the community what has previously been removed, such as certain businesses, but the residential area seems stable.  Currently, there are not a lot of rentals and the residents are economically and racially diverse.</p> \r\n  <p>The Prospect Protectors neighborhood includes 100 homes but does not border Michigan Avenue or Kalamazoo Street.  Upon returning to the area eight years ago her neighborhood was not very interactive, but this stay-at-home mom soon jumped into volunteer work making the changes that were needed.  Involving other families with children into group activities, including three boys of her own, has been beneficial to all of the households.  They enjoy participating in Trash Days, Lugnut games, potlucks and block parties. Neighbors get to know each other during these activities, thus <u>forging bonds</u> that are beneficial during possible emergencies.</p> \r\n  <p>Even though the name for the neighborhood group seems “defensive” she has never felt afraid or in danger in her area.

She states that as a person you have to “have a good attitude and fight back by changing things you don’t like about your neighborhood.”  Since they have lived in their house they have seen a lot of <u>positive changes</u> with “forward movement and good things happening.”  There can be rough stuff in any neighborhood, but “you try to set examples and do the best you can to make it what you want it to be” and “encourage others to do the same” building on that capacity.  “Pieces of a vision can be seen emerging” which are <u>inspirational words</u> from a local community leader.</p> \r\n','2009-03-30 19:08:56','2009-04-14 12:55:31',NULL,'Prospect Protectors','gardner',15,NULL,NULL,NULL),(19,'Project Director Wants "Uniformity" for MI Avenue','Seated comfortably in his airy office suite, <b>Brian Anderson</b> has a busy day of answering emails, returning phone calls, keeping in contact with East Lansing’s and Lansing township’s representatives, and more ahead of him.

He also feels that if the community sets a good example with this project, then the redevelopment policies can be translated into other neighboring communities that are in need of improvement and stimulation.\r\n\r\nAnderson believes that a website has a lot of potential to be valuable, as long as it is <b>“community-based and user-generated.</b> In the most hopeful sense, a website can take on a life of its own,” he adds. He likes the idea of a website that is based in the eastside of the Corridor: “It could work as a communication tool and be a good billboard for Michigan Avenue.” Anderson personally enjoys message boards, as they serve as a conversation for the community.\r\n\r\nThe overriding goal here, according to Anderson, is <b>“to bring uniformity and cohesiveness between the three municipalities.”</b> Lansing, Lansing Township, and East Lansing need to be connected by something other than a simple ‘road’; they need to be connected by a beautiful, interesting passage of life.

Part of Gone Wired’s purpose is also to serve as a community gathering space. Four years after the café’s opening in 2005, it serves customers throughout the day but also attracts a variety of local groups including a chess club, a space exploration roundtable, and a poetry club which includes members from as far as Jackson.\r\n\r\nDavis has lived in Lansing all of her life and says that the Eastside is her favorite part. ‘I don’t know if I would want to be anywhere else,’she says. Davis noted the great diversity of the area which includes immigrants and students from around the world as well as people who grew up in Lansing.\r\n\r\nHer biggest hope for development along Michigan Avenue is for there to be more green space, especially geared towards pedestrians. Davis believes that businesses along Michigan Avenue can help with the development project by mobilizing their customers and helping them to express their interests.\r\n\r\nDavis’ favorite part of Gone Wired is meeting the customers.

Glancing around the vibrant neighborhood cafe, you notice at once that he is not alone. The cafe is buzzing for a Friday afternoon and full of students studying, professionals meeting, friends catching up, locals consumed in a good read, and parents with their children, getting a quick caffeine fix. \r\n\r\nThough his goals and aspirations for the Corridor are great, Brinkley is practical when it comes to making these ideas a reality. “The change needs to come from the residents,” says Brinkley, pointing out that large scale projects like the proposed changes to the Lansing City Market make great headlines, but may take years to complete.\r\n\r\nInstead, Brinkley believes that the best start to Corridor development and improvement will come from local entrepreneurial initiative, from residents and nonresidents who dream of starting a small business and growing the area. Brinkley admits that the current lack of initiative is one of the major problems along the Corridor, as well as the lack of a great connection among the residents of Lansing and East Lansing and students of Michigan State University. A former student of Michigan State at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, he has experienced this disconnect personally. \r\n\r\nBrinkley hopes that the solutions to this lack of connection will be an improved public transit system, storefronts that sit close to the sidewalks and Michigan Avenue, increasing pedestrian traffic, and an improved aesthetic that mixes historic facades with modern ones in a thoughtful but naturally occurring way. Most importantly, Brinkley hopes that the Corridor emerges with a distinct “sense of place” that residents and can identify with and in which they take pride. \r\n\r\nBrinkley’s vision for the Corridor in the year 2025 is a vibrant urban environment, a walkable hub with stops such as distinctive restaurants and bars, entertainment venues, unique retail, and even its own streetcar. It is a spontaneous, unpredictable, and organic place, not unlike Chicago’s Magnificent Mile. His hope is that people are excited about the change and understand their role and investment in it. As for this website, Brinkley encourages residents to participate constructively, to network, and to allow this site to become a self-sustaining nucleus for social collaboration, invention, and development.

So when she decided to attend to Michigan State University one of the first things she did was enroll in a program to volunteer at a local elementary school. \r\n\r\nDuring Laura’s freshman year at Michigan State University, she volunteered her time to work at Bingham Elementary School in downtown Lansing. Twice to three times a week Laura tutored select students during the afternoon and then helped run the after school program. \r\n\r\nWithout a doubt, Bingham Elementary stands out against other schools in Michigan, but not in a good way. According to its MEAP scores, Bingham places among the lowest of illiteracy rates for the state. A large part of Laura’s role was to create a positive and fun environment in regards to reading and to teach even the simplest concepts such as the alphabet.\r\n\r\nThese problems arent strictly related to academics. The mind set of these young children seem really skewed. One thing that stood out to was when Laura had a conversation with a young boy. \" One day we were talking with the 5th graders about what they wanted to be when they grew up. I went up to boy and ask him this question. He responded a Pimp. \" This type of attitude was a normal scene amongst the kids Laura said. She hopes that some day in the near future that the school can improve its education program so the kids can have a brighter future and want to grow up to be teachers, doctors, or lawyers. \r\n\r\nLauras experiences really bring to life some of the problems facing the Michigan Avenue project. It is a known fact that the Lansing area has been hit hard by this economic recession. But the educational system of Lansing is also in bad state. Looking at Lauras time at Bingham Elementary its clear that changes need to be made to improve Lansings schools. \r\n','2009-04-14 02:12:32','2009-04-14 02:13:19','https://www.edline.net/pages/Bingham_School','121 Bingham St','thoma587',24,'https://www.edline.net/dynimg/docid/3821870711274732770/ea/false/cci/1239675055588',NULL,NULL),(24,'Rebecca Butcher','As a senior at Michigan State University, Rebecca Butcher has lived out over twenty years with the Lansing area as her home.

He is the third generation to maintain the business established in 1922, still in the original location. Paul has worked at Emil’s nearly his entire life, and has contributed greatly to the restaurant, creating new drink and food recipes as well as adding to the décor. He has spent much time “going out not just into the city but other towns and countries and bringing back ideas for the restaurant.”\r\n\r\nPaul sees Emil’s most prominent contribution to the area as tradition. Emil’s is undoubtedly one of Lansing’s greatest landmarks. “If all else fails, people know they can come to Emil’s and they won’t be getting a beeper or a pager… you will be called pretty much by your first name.” Of course, there are exceptions, but Paul and past owners of the restaurant have strived to maintain a warm, friendly relationship with not just their regular customers, but newcomers as well. “I think people really enjoy getting a written check at the end of their meal instead of a computer printout,” Paul said. “We really try to make people feel like they are people rather than cattle.” This type of personal attention is rare in today’s wide world of chain restaurants and has surely been a main ingredient in keeping Emil’s in business for almost ninety years.\r\n\r\nWith this amount of tradition and care wrapped up in the restaurant, it’s no wonder that Emil’s list of patrons includes those as far back as the notorious Al Capone, to circus bears – to modern-day celebrities en route from the Breslin or Wharton Center, to loyal and hungry Spartan alumni. The charming ambiance created by the authentic stained glass décor and soft tavern-esque lighting is certainly reminiscent of an era passed.\r\n\r\nRegarding the state of the Michigan Avenue Corridor, Paul said that it has “definitely come a long way.” With the economy struggling, there are too many vacant buildings from failed businesses. What the area really needs is “more business, more commerce, and more people,” as Paul says, but that’s easier said than done. However, things have looked up in past years, as “all the businesses that have moved onto this block alone have really helped,” he said. In addition to these newer businesses, public transportation to this area continues to hold strong, with both the busses and the trolley stopping right near Emil’s. \r\n','2009-04-14 05:44:20','2009-04-14 05:49:16',NULL,'2012 E Michigan Ave, Lansing','Ainsley',10,NULL,NULL,NULL),(26,'Linking Lansing & U','<p><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3409/3440955562_f9476fd4f2.jpg?v=0\" alt=\"A girl skydiving.\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" align=\"left\" hspace=10></a></p>\r\n<h2>Lauren Schuman</h2>is a student at Michigan State University involved in the student division of *Linking Lansing & U*, an initiative created by the city of Lansing designed to create programs to engage university students in events in Lansing. Linking Lansing & U addresses a problem the city has faced for years: the disconnect between thousands of students in the area – the brightest and most promising future leaders in the local community.\r\n\r\nLauren has served on the board of this freshly-founded organization since August of 2008. This year, their largest project was a collaboration with Lansing for the 24th annual Silver Bells in the City event. They managed to transport more than 500 students from MSU campus to the event in downtown Lansing. The festive busses were decorated and played music en route from three designated “Silver Stops” on campus down to the Capitol. “We just wanted to get more MSU kids down there and it ended up being a really good turnout,” Lauren said. “Silver Bells was a really big thing because we started from scratch and this was the first year that the student group Linking Lansing & U was around.”\r\n\r\nLauren expressed major interest in the Michigan Avenue Corridor Project. \r\n“MSU is kind of separate from stuff that’s going on in Lansing. I think it’d be really awesome if there were more groups.” Improving the Corridor will be a big task and will require more interest and participation and effort from the community. Lauren spoke about this problem, saying “I feel like we were kind of lost, like, ‘Where are we going to start?’ because it’s such a big thing.” She comments that there is more to Lansing than the stereotype many MSU students have applied. “I think the art and culture areas are really beneficial - I don’t think a lot of people know they’re really down there.” Art fairs, festivals, and restaurants fill the streets throughout the year and a very important portion of the community is unaware.\r\n\r\nFor more information on Linking Lansing & U, click <a href=\"http://www.lansingmi.gov/invest/linking_lansing_and_u/index.jsp\">here.</a>\r\n\r\n(MSU’s student group’s site is expected to be up and running in April.)\r\n\r\n','2009-04-14 05:52:48','2009-04-14 05:53:54',NULL,'Michigan State University','Ainsley',10,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27,'A Woman of Many Interests','<p><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3615/3462332413_59edc6ca06.jpg?v=0\" alt=\"Photo of Ann.\" width=\"222\" height=\"185\" align=\"left\" hspace=10></a></p><h2>Ann Nichols</h2>is a lawyer, professional writer, food blogger, wife, mother, and avid community activist. She grew up in the area, went to Okemos High School, and after living elsewhere, returned as a permanent resident in East Lansing. Having lived in the area most of her life, and getting first-hand experience with living among college students, she became a core member of the <a href=\"http://wealllivehere.org/\">CRC</a> (Community Relations Coalition). The CRC’s main focus is working with permanent East Lansing residents and students living off-campus to build trust, foster cooperation and communication, and build knowledge of responsibilities applicable to all residents of East Lansing.\r\n\r\nWhen she discovered the city’s plans for City Center II, she and other permanent residents were alarmed. The plans called for a “ten-story, mixed-use building” to spring up right in their backyard. “Either way your kids are going to be throwing a Frisbee through the front window or back window,” Ann said while discussing her problems with the plans. This new structure is changing the corner of Grand River and Abbot Road enormously – restaurants and businesses have been ousted, historic buildings and affordable student housing will be removed, and local children will lose their place to play. However, the permanent residents “didn’t object because they didn’t want change, but because it was sprung on them.”\r\n\r\nAt this point, plans had been approved and it seemed like it was too late to have much input on the situation. Ann’s outlook eventually became “that it was going to happen and I had to make it be good … There were some things to be grateful for.”\r\n\r\n“The biggest thing they did wrong was they did not get community buy-in,” Ann said. “By the time they got around to telling us it was going to happen, they had an architect, they had a plan…It didn’t reflect architecture on campus or anything around here. If they had started out with getting some community buy-in, consent, and understanding … there would have been compromise. We wouldn’t feel that money talks and the city is really pushing an agenda that doesn’t necessarily involve respecting our neighborhood.”\r\n\r\nWith the Michigan Avenue Corridor project, considering Ann’s concerns with City Center II would help tremendously in cooperation efforts with the community on some of the proposed improvements.\r\n\r\nAnn offers tips to help in future urban development and maintaining an acceptable dialog between developers and the community, stating: “If people feel like somebody wants to know what they think, you have immediate connection with them, whereas if you surprise them and say ‘you’re too late,’ you’re going to have angry people.” She adds that it’s important to talk to people up front because the building process is complicated and easily misunderstood. Residents need to understand that “if you have developers coming in and they’re buying property, that the community doesn’t have the right to call the shots.” What there needs to be is up front dialog where the community’s voice is heard and their ideas receive a direct response.\r\n\r\nAs far as what improvements Ann think could be made to the Corridor specifically, she mentioned liking the safety and aesthetics of Old Town. “I don’t see any reason why it can’t be extended back this way.” She mentioned the addition of another non-chain book store for the area, as well as expanding the selection of fine restaurants.\r\n\r\nFor another perspective on Ann and her thoughts, visit her fantastic culinary blog, <a href=\"http://imagineannie.wordpress.com/\">Forest Street Kitchen</a>.\r\n','2009-04-14 06:05:17','2009-04-21 16:13:14',NULL,'East Lansing','Ainsley',10,NULL,NULL,NULL),(28,'Jeremy Herliczek','Jeremy Herliczek has been apart of Lansings community since 2001 and he has loved each of the eight years that hes worked and lived in Lansing.

The progress along the avenue and the role of small community organizations is highlighted in some of the improvements Armory Alliance has experienced.\r\n\r\nWhen Fountain and her family moved into the area from nearby in Lansing, there were crime problems, including arson of playground equipment, broken bottles and loitering teens in areas she liked to take her children to visit. In response to these problems, Fountain and her neighbors organized a meeting and invited a police officer. The officer suggested they start a neighborhood watch. Fountain took the role of starting the organization and has continued to play a pivotal part since then.\r\n\r\nSince its inception, the neighborhood watch has installed new playground equipment, received permission for overnight parking along streets from the city to alleviate parking problems, and fought crime around their houses. Fountain noted that the most important role of program is that it encourages interaction among neighbors, creating a close knit community, which in turn drives down crime. \r\n\r\nThe role of acting as neighborhood leader hasn’t been without its challenges. Besides challenges within the neighborhood such as settling disputes, she has also had to work with community members to address concerns to larger organizations, such as the school system or Sparrow Hospital, when projects impacting the neighborhood are planned.\r\nNot everyone listens to local concerns. ‘It can make you feel powerless,’ Fountain noted about those times when community concerns were overlooked or promises were broken during construction projects. Fountain noted that not every attempt by the community has been futile-a recent planned expansion of a gas station which included turning it into a 24 hour business was canceled in part because of neighborhood concerns. \r\n\r\nFountain says that the best part of Michigan Avenue is that it is so close enough to walk or bike to many businesses or locations. She hopes to have more park-like locations for pedestrians to sit, with trees, benches, flowers, or fountains. She also hopes that new businesses continue to move to the corridor. \r\n\r\nCommunity organizations like the neighborhood watch help people take on small projects which can help improve the corridor said Fountain. Because most people are quite busy, projects are rarely completed unless someone rallies for the cause. Like Fountain when she was organizing the Armory Alliance watch program two decades ago, such people can also transform the Michigan Avenue corridor.  \r\n','2009-04-14 22:22:34','2009-04-21 22:58:12',NULL,'Armory Alliance','Ryan Norris',13,NULL,NULL,NULL),(31,'Eric Larson-Impression 5 Science Museum','<table class=\"image styled\" \r\nalign=\"right\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5em\"\r\ncellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n<caption align=\"bottom\">Impression 5, or I-5 as some call it, features many exhibits, including a larger than life eyeball.<br><br></caption>\r\n<tr><td><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3404/3443159144_b43a6d41f3.jpg?v=1239748485\"><img title=\"Impression 5 Eyeball\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3404/3443159144_b43a6d41f3.jpg?v=1239748485\" \r\nalt=\"Impression 5 larger than life eyeball\" align=\"right\" width=\"240\" height=\"300\"  /></a></td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<big><big><big><big>B</big></big></big></big>eing at Impression 5 Science Center is practically in Eric Larson’s blood. Born just 3 years after its opening,  Larson’s mother was one of the founding volunteers. As a child he spent much time at Impression-5 and fell in love with it. As a teen ager he volunteered there and eventually became an employee as a junior and senior in college. Upon graduation from Olivet, he became the education director, working on the exhibit floor, managing operations  and creating educational programs. Now as the executive director, Larson  continues to manage a staff of 30, but he also spends time developing relationships with sponsors, applying for grants and foundation support, and planning on ways to broaden the scope of the science center. \r\n\r\nI-5 as some visitors like to call the science center is a ‘hands-on’ museum in downtown Lansing, part of the ‘museum district,’ which also includes River Walk Theatre, the RE Olds Transportation Museum, and the Michigan Association of Professional Surveyors Museum. During a year Impression 5 receives over 100,0000 visitors and engages 25,000 more people through outreach events in the community.\r\n\r\nLarson believes that Michigan Avenue is incredibly important to the Lansing and East Lansing communities. Currently, Impression 5 is developing plans to be part of the development process as  educational resource. One recent project Larson and Impression 5 worked on is an exhibit at the museum explaining the recent rain gardens installed on sections of Michigan Avenue in downtown Lansing, explaining how they filter storm water before it flows into the Grand River and why such gardens are important. Larson also noted that the museum can educate people before they arrive by encouraging visitors to take alternate means of transportation, such as walking or biking along the River Trail. \r\n\r\nAny visitors to Impression 5 come from East Lansing, and staff and volunteers at the museum often come from Michigan State. Larson said two staff members bike to work year round and said  that he would like to see better transportation options along Michigan Avenue, such as bike lanes and access to the River Trail.\r\n\r\nThe next big project at Impression 5 is the installation of wireless internet through the museum to provide patrons with free internet access. Larson envisions visitors bringing their own laptops or using laptops provided by the museum to go beyond the limitations of exhibit displays to learn about science. ‘We want to change the way informal learning environments work,’ said Larson. He hopes that such additions will also help the museum serve a broader audience, improving service to high school students for example.  In future, Larson hopes the museum is able to move into a building which utilizes state of the art green technology so that the museum itself can be an exhibit in sustainable and energy efficient lifestyles.

These Turkish teahouses were unlike any restaurant or café she’d ever experienced; some were situated in caves, others encouraged you to take off your shoes at the door. They featured live performances and an array of healthy foods. The overall atmosphere was very comfortable and relaxing, two essentials in the development of Magdalena’s Teahouse. \r\n\r\n<b>The Vegan Menu</b>\r\nAfter two years of being strictly a performing arts café, Miko decided in 2006 to add a vegan kitchen to Magdalena’s. Her interest in a vegan lifestyle came from curing herself of Ulcerative Colitis simply by changing her diet. Today she finds “a lot of people coming to me after they’ve been sick, whether they’ve undergone chemotherapy or endured some other disease.” She credits, undoubtedly, her raw diet for keeping people healthy. The idea of “eating without heating” actually keeps a lot more flavor in food, “when you cook food, like meat, and you can smell it, you are losing a lot of flavor and nutrients.” Miko’s unique vegan restaurant offers a variety of raw entrees consisting of vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, sprouts, and greens. She even serves a special five-course dinner every Thursday and Saturday. \r\n\r\n<b>Hopes for Michigan Avenue</b>\r\nShe hopes the set up of her restaurant and menu, which took six months to develop, will allow people to watch a show while eating healthy – as opposed to the traditional American bar that serves greasy foods and unhealthier options. Additionally, she would like to have “outdoor café seating and beautification, which would be possible if Michigan Avenue were to limit its traffic to two lanes and reduce the speed limit.” Making the corridor pedestrian friendly would immensely help instill a sense of community and quaintness in the area.\r\n\r\n<b>Changing an Image</b>\r\nAnother thing Miko hopes to change is the Teahouse image and how the public perceives it. Miko would really like to give her business “a more professional edge without the ‘hippy-fied’ image.” She wants people to recognize that it is a vegan restaurant with open mic nites and the goal of the Teahouse is to make people feel at home. Magdalena’s is not just another café or night club – it is a dining experience all in its own.\r\n\r\nFor more information visit:  \r\n<a href=\"http://www.magdalenasteahouse.com\">Magdalenas Teahouse</a>\r\n\r\n','2009-04-19 23:33:17','2009-04-19 23:47:58',NULL,'2006 E.

With a B.S. in kinesiology, she’s looking to continue her schooling in Lansing Community College’s nursing program, which means she will be spending even more time down town. Though optimistic about her future as a nurse, Kristin isn’t too thrilled about staying in Lansing. “Having grown up in the area, I never felt like Lansing was a very inviting city. It just always seemed run down, and I could never understand why Lansing was chosen as Michigan’s capitol.”\r\n\r\n<b>Where the Grads are Migrating</b>\r\nKristin finds herself frequently making trips to Chicago and Denver, two cities that unquestionably have a lot to offer for all ages, especially when it comes to the night life, shopping, and live music. “I’ve always enjoyed East Lansing’s night life, but now that I’ve graduated I feel like the whole area caters to college students.” Smith is looking to live somewhere that she could enjoy going out on the weekends and not feel out of place or merely living in a college town. Just as most East Lansing’s stores and businesses are conveniently situated for the students along the outskirts of Michigan State’s campus (more specifically, Grand River Avenue), Kristin believes a night life along Michigan Avenue would thrive by attracting the professionals, subsequently a more mature scene of people who live in the vicinity of Lansing.\r\n\r\n<b>Aesthetics and Athletics</b>\r\nAdditionally, Kristin wishes Lansing were more aesthetically pleasing and “greener”. Kristen says she loves to exercise and be outside, “but I wish there were more parks and ways for people to be active outdoors.” She thinks more trees and plants along the corridor would “definitely make Lansing more inviting…I would actually enjoy spending time downtown!” The current downtown, for the most part, is characterized by uneven and cracked sidewalks, few plants and trees, and not a whole lot of “outdoorsy” hang outs. Kristin says, “People are more inclined to be active and outdoors, even if it’s going for a walk, if the scenery is appealing.”\r\n\r\n<b>Retaining the Talent</b>\r\nBy simply revitalizing Lansing, especially Michigan Avenue, the city would retain many well-qualified graduates, like Kristin, who would otherwise seek jobs in more modern and creative cities. “Downtown Lansing is definitely long overdue for a major makeover. Renovating Michigan Avenue would make the city of Lansing more appealing and would attract a lot of talented people.”\r\n','2009-04-19 23:43:48','2009-04-19 23:43:48',NULL,'Lansing area','becca',19,NULL,NULL,NULL),(35,'HC Berger Co.: Dave Berger','<b>The Foundation</b>\r\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3577/3427036450_df490310eb.jpg?v=0\" align=\"right\">Founded in 1946, HC Berger Co. has been servicing businesses with “state of the art office solutions” for over half a century.

Dave says, “It won’t! We don’t sell retail…it’s not like people will be wandering around Michigan Avenue, wondering ‘how about coffee and a $40,000 printer?’” Aside from perhaps increasing his property’s value, Dave does however, strongly believe beautifying Michigan Avenue will help a lot of the smaller businesses along the corridor, and most of the owners he has gotten to know over the years. “There are a lot of great cafes, restaurants, and hangout places around here that hardly get any recognition,” Berger continues, “cleaning up Michigan Avenue will certainly make Lansing more appealing to residents and will attract more outsiders.”\r\n\r\n<b>A Prime Example</b>\r\nWhile the success of his business isn’t likely to be affected by renovations along Michigan Avenue, Dave is enthusiastic about attracting outsiders to experience the quaintness of Lansing businesses and communities. “The Eastside neighborhoods have really come a long way,” he reflects on the community surrounding Michigan Avenue, “it would be nice to see a similar renovation implemented along the whole stretch of Michigan Avenue.” HC Berger Co. remains a prime example of a family-owned and family-operated small business success along downtown Lansing’s main strip.\r\n','2009-04-19 23:46:54','2009-04-19 23:46:54',NULL,'1908 East Michigan Avenue','becca',19,NULL,NULL,NULL),(36,'A model citizen','Recently, I interviewed Rick Kibbey.

After spending four years in San Francisco working for Visa, the draw of family pulled her back to the area. Since then she has climbed the business ladder to the position of Senior Product Manager for Fifth Third Processing Solutions, which involves working with the processing of credit cards. With over 30 years of experience in the field, she has held this current position for the past two years, overseeing the services and products that Fifth Third Processing Solutions offers to a variety of merchant clients.\r\n\r\nAn amazing thing about her work in the area is that, so far, it has been unaffected by the current economic woes. While many may feel questionable about this fact, it shows that not every area of the economy is floundering, and is a sure sign of hope for the area. In a state with such large economic hardships, being able to show that the economy has not totally collapsed should definitely be reason to look to the future.\r\n\r\nSince she has been back, Diane has also become deeply involved with the community. Currently she acts as the President of the Chesterfield Hills Neighborhood Association. In this position, she helps to maintain the traditional appeal of the neighborhood, as well as numerous other tasks that directly concern the lives of the people within the neighborhood. Holding this position was also what initially got her involved with the Michigan Avenue Corridor Project. As such, she believes in the potential of the project, and what it could accomplish, and is excited to see it put into action. While she is still cautious about the project, she also believes that communication will be absolutely critical for success.

Located in the former U.S. Bank building, Troppo is one of those places that can pull off effortlessly elegant, chic, and refined, without being stuffy. This balances seamlessly with a comfort that makes patrons feel at home. Troppo is cool, because it doesn’t try too hard to be. When it moved to Downtown Lansing in 2003, the goal was to fill a void in the downtown area. General Manager, Drew Bossler says the company saw an exciting potential for growth in the area, an opportunity that couldn’t be passed up.\r\n\r\nBossler is a graduate of Michigan State University’s Hospitality Business program and shares an interest in the development and expansion of the Michigan Avenue Corridor. He is a member of the Promotions Committee of the Lansing Principal Shopping District, which aims at business retention, recruitment and marketing in the Downtown Lansing area. He says that what makes the Corridor great is the “organic nature of business” and improvement will come from emphasizing this quality. Bringing new businesses to the area that are owned and operated by residents is a great first step, encouraging financial and personal investment. This will create jobs, a demand for housing, retail, and nightlife, and will increase overall spending and revenues in the area. \r\n\r\nTroppo and its sister restaurant, Tavern on the Square, are already repositioning themselves to fill this demand. Troppo has designs to move across the street to the Southeast corner of Michigan Avenue (the National City building), while Tavern will move into its current location. Bossler says the goal of the Troppo expansion will be “to create a more dynamic space, with more areas available for wedding receptions, and private functions” as well as offer a larger space for current patrons, including the possibility of a sky deck. This move will add a second level to Troppo and more than double its current size. The sky deck will upgrade one of Troppo’s best features, its famed terrace. In the bigger picture Bossler says this relocation will help “change the face of the Corridor,” making it more accessible to pedestrian traffic and giving the facade a facelift.\r\n\r\nImprovement of the Michigan Avenue Corridor will depend in large part on cooperation and communication among community residents, students, the private sector, and the local and state governments. Bossler noted that communal, virtual spaces such as this site will be essential in bringing groups together to generate ideas, discourse, and action along the Corridor. Along with organizations like the Lansing Principal Shopping District, and local economic development corporations, these virtual spaces will promote advocacy and support for all aspects of Corridor life; hopefully yielding tangible and profitable results.\r\n\r\nBossler has an equally hopeful message to the community: “I’d like the viewers of this site to understand how deeply appreciated and important their interest in the Downtown Lansing area is,” and stressed that this community is one that really has the potential to make great things happen for the area.                     \r\n','2009-04-21 15:09:30','2009-04-21 20:31:15','www.troppo.org','Downtown Lansing','Steph Carlisle',9,NULL,NULL,NULL),(44,'Liz Trexler: Lansing Refugee Development Volunteer','<big><big><big>M</big></big></big>eet Liz Trexler, former volunteer at the Lansing Refugee Development Center located on Pennsylvania in Lansing.

These programs are independently funded by Christ Lutheran Church, and aided by the efforts of 350 volunteers annually from Michigan State University and Lansing.  The volunteers are guided by the director of the RDC, Shirin Timms.\r\n\r\nShirin, who also teaches political science at Jackson Community College, says that the most rewarding part of working at the RDC is “being able to witness (the refugees) journey, and be inspired about what theyre able to overcome”.  Many refugees in the Lansing area have come from hellish conditions, such as women who have been persecuted by the Taliban, or Burmese refugees fleeing oppression.  Shirin also explains that the RDCs location directly off Michigan Avenue is helpful: “The bus brings a lot of students from MSU, and the refugees can use the bus, shop, and go to school.”\r\n\r\nAs for future development on Michigan Avenue, “its a matter of figuring out where we fit.”   While the refugees may come from areas where computer use is limited, technological education is one of the many programs the RDC offers in its computer lab.  Shirin sees a website concerning Michigan Avenue as a resource for newcomers - “We wouldnt use it for networking...it could show what job and housing opportunities are available, and MSU students would learn about the neighborhood.”  While a Michigan Avenue website would help to inform refugees and other residents, the RDC still needs donations and volunteers to provide its critical services.

I had an internship in Lansing, through which I got contacts in Lansing, which got me a job in Lansing.”  As for her job as a communications advisor for the Democrats, Laura states that they do a lot with helping people deal with foreclosures, but also says “in the minority, its hard to get anything done.  We have to push and fight for causes with twice as much effort.”\r\n\r\nLaura sees Michigan Avenue as divided.  “I think more towards the downtown, its defintely growing.  But between downtown and East Lansing...itd be cooler to see that built up.”  To her, it often seems that many business on Michigan Avenue go unnoticed, especially in the Stadium District: “Im driving by a coffee shop and Im wondering, Do people even know about it?”  To promote these new business, Laura thinks that ribbon cutting ceremonies would be a good idea.  “The only way Id hear about (business openings) would be from the press, I guess.”\r\n\r\nShe also thinks that a website detailing opportunities on Michigan Avenue could be a great benefit to the area.  Laura thinks that  a map would be beneficial to the website - “A lot of people think everythings on Washington Square.”  She also sees the website as a resource to promote the Lansing area: “A lot of the public would be interested in revitalization efforts – making Lansing more appealing.”  Mainly, she sees a Michigan Avenue website as an information source that could keep young college graduates from leaving Michigan, starting with publicizing internship programs.  “Make (Lansing) more appealing so theyll try to look, maybe get an internship.”  Mainly, Laura wants people to know that Lansing is vibrant.  “People dont know about the bars...theres a lot more for people here.”','2009-04-21 22:19:13','2009-04-21 22:23:30',NULL,'Washington Square','rossmanp',8,NULL,NULL,NULL),(49,'Video to Go','<IMG SRC=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3585/3464119510_4d55c954ec.jpg?v=0\" ALIGN=\"center\">\r\nIn the past three decades, the Frandor area has seen a lot of businesses come and go.  However, one constant during that time has been Video to Go, a video rental store on 300 North Clippert that started in 1981 with 500 VHS and Beta cassettes.  Since then, the store has grown and modernized, and now has over 30,000 movies in DVD or Blu-ray format available to rent or to buy.  These 30,000 movies range from todays blockbusters to classics such as Gandhi, Funny Girl, and  An American in Paris.  Tom Leach, Video to Gos owner, says that MSU has been supportive of his stores variety: “With the university, people in this town are more acculturated to movies...we have a lot of films that are no longer in print.” \r\n\r\nHaving done business in Frandor for 28 years, Tom appreciates the areas accessibility.  “(Frandors) a great area between East Lansing and Lansing.  Theres lots of parking, and people have to get out and get in really quick.”  Just like his location is easily accessible, Tom says that his store is accessible to “anyone that appreciates film.”  Its easy to be intimidated by Video to Gos large selection, but their website (http://videotogo.formovies.com) has a list of all their movies, and links to movie news and showtimes.  At the store, the staff is knowledgeable as well: “The staff all loves movies, and we dont have much turnover.  People work here until they graduate or leave town.”\r\n\r\nAs for  a website connecting resources on the Michigan Avenue Corridor, Tom thinks that that would be valuable for businesses, especially with the new developments in Frandor in the past few years.  “Frandor used to have a merchants association run by independent merchants to help with advertising.  Now we have a lot of big box stores, and all their advertising is run by a national office.”  Tom believes that a website could help promote businesses by listing their names, hours of operation, and their phone numbers.  Even though other businesses have been struggling, Video to Go has been doing well, thanks to their customers.  “Hollywood and Blockbuster are struggling.  We havent tried to expand, we stay here in Lansing.  We have a huge client base, and we appreciate that.”','2009-04-21 22:27:49','2009-04-21 22:28:48',NULL,'Frandor','rossmanp',8,NULL,NULL,NULL),(50,'Main Attraction for Some people','Abdul Qadir—Lansing Ethnic Food manager—makes life for people from Arabian Peninsula more enjoyable. Many MSU students from Arabian Peninsula visit Michigan Avenue weekly to shop from Lansing Ethnic Food. Abdul Qadir connects well with his customers from Arabian Peninsula because he speaks their language fluently and he is familiar with their culture. He likes to consider them as friends who he is constantly seeking feedback. \r\n\r\nFor example, he heard his customer call rice and chicken Kabsa. He did some research to find out the recipe of Kabsa , and now he offers it. On the other hand, they did not hesitate to call his personal cell phone to make special orders for their food fests.  They are able do food fests similar to back home because Abdul Qadir makes special effort to prepare their food. \r\n\r\n\r\nLansing Ethnic Food is not limited to customers from that area. Sometime his customers from the Arabian Peninsula would order food for their parties. Their friends would ask about the place they bought the food from; now these friends buy food monthly from Abdul Qadir. Furthermore, usually local residents would check out the store. When they enter the shop, they notice the smell of the spicy food and order some to try. While they are waiting for the food, they usually examine the products which probably they never saw before. For some of these explorers, they become regular customers. Lansing Ethnic food is the main attraction for many MSU students from the Arabian Peninsula to visit Michigan Avenue.

On his way home, Ali stops by a store to have a drink and relax. The best time for Ali to run is in the summer one hour before sunset. There is not a lot of traffic and some people walking on the Avenue. \r\nAli still remembers his first time he walked on Michigan Avenue. He stopped by a hookah bar.

The CCED stands as a vital component of Michigan State University’s ‘University Outreach and Engagement’.  According to Melcher and the CCED’s mission statement, it aims to better local communities and help individuals understand and thrive within their social and economic situations.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Often times, Melcher finds himself working with low income and or distressed communities in Michigan.  He points outs that the current economic woes in the state are anything but new.  “We’ve been seeing the decline of our cities for 30, 40, even 50 years now,” says Melcher,  “and Michigan has been in a recession for a decade.”</p>\r\n  \r\n<p>Melcher sees both innovation and creativity as major stepping-stones in correcting the problems the state is facing.  He presents the argument that Michigan is struggling largely due to its inability to part with its traditional ideals based on an industrial and manufacturing economy.  “We need to take from the old model, and apply what we’ve learned to a new and innovative one,” he says.</p>  \r\n<p>Melcher believes the transformation of the Michigan Avenue Corridor, and the repairing of the broken economy in Michigan, starts within the state itself.  He suggests alternative and intermodal forms of transportation as “symbols of progress” within the corridor, along with strengthening small businesses and helping them to stay alive.  Rather than attempting to attract business and talent from other areas, he advocates development within the communities and neighborhoods; a sort of “grow your own” mentality.  Melcher encourages educating youth to partake and engage in an intelligent and creative knowledge-based economy.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>As far as the Michigan Avenue Corridor Project is concerned, Melcher believes the best way to get people involved is to catch their interest.  “We have to find out what systems can be used to gather interest and political clout,” he says.  The prospect of presenting people with exciting ideas and allowing them to see and think outside the box is a genuinely exciting experience for Melcher.  “That’s what cutting edge is all about,” he says.</p>\r\n\r\n','2009-04-27 09:31:25','2009-04-27 10:06:17',NULL,'Lansing','JChenoweth',21,NULL,NULL,NULL),(53,'Capitol Macintosh: David Smith','<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/37711425@N02/3478857267/\" title=\"DSC00571 by chenow10, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3392/3478857267_14a98e47bd.jpg\" width=\"285\" height=\"200\" align=\"right\" alt=\"DSC00571\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<p>Meet David Smith, Lansing resident and local business owner.  “I’ve lived in Lansing for about six or seven years, but have been coming here for a long time; my mother lived here,” Smith says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost three years ago in May of 2006, Smith opened Capitol Macintosh to serve the Lansing and East Lansing community.  The store offers repair and service on all Apple products both in and out of warranty.  The staff also provides customers with data backup services, network integration, training and consulting services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Capitol Macintosh is close enough to MSU to attract college students; however the stretch of Michigan Avenue that separates the two isolates the store from campus somewhat.  Smith sees this as a plus.  He says the short distance helps to weed out the constant barrage of IPod questions and repair his staff would face being located in the middle of campus.  This allows Capitol Mac to concentrate more on its customers.  “Our focus here is on service,” Smith says.</p>\r\n<p>Concerning the Michigan Avenue Corridor that connects Capitol Macintosh to its customers, Smith says he’d like to see a better infrastructure for public transportation.  This would, ”get people out of their cars,” and increase the amount of pedestrian activity in the area.  He’d also like to see more bars and restaurants with outdoor seating.  These improvements could help to attract people to the area and Smith believes local residents would take advantage of the new opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>The biggest thing in regard to helping the Michigan Avenue Corridor Smith advocates is what he calls, “buying and thinking local.” He encourages people to take pride in the community and support local businesses.  He points out that it’s harder than ever for small businesses to compete with large-scale chains and the fact that most products and services can now be purchased online.  “Most people could probably shop and find everything they need locally,” he says.  “If their time and gas are worth something to them, buying local makes sense; you just have to get people to think.“</p>   \r\n\r\n','2009-04-27 09:46:38','2009-04-27 09:59:28',NULL,'Lansing','JChenoweth',21,NULL,NULL,NULL),(54,'Joseph Sullivan','Joseph Sullivan is a Michigan State University student studying Human Resources and Sociology.  Living just North of MSU’s campus on Harrison Road, he uses the Michigan Avenue Corridor on almost a daily basis for both work and pleasure.   \r\n	\r\nSullivan works as a pizza delivery driver for Pizza Hut in East Lansing.  He delivers to the Brody Complex and many primarily student-occupied apartments on Michigan Avenue.  \r\n	\r\nThough many of the customers he delivers to are students, the Michigan Avenue Corridor has introduced him to individuals from all walks of life.  “There’s an elderly man that lives in one of the neighborhoods just off Michigan Ave and Harrison,” says Sullivan.  “He’s got over 400 delivery orders at Pizza Hut and he always tips me five dollars.”\r\n	\r\nWork isn’t the only reason Sullivan uses the Michigan Avenue Corridor.  He frequents the Blimpie on Michigan Avenue two or three times a week though there’s one located on Grand River, closer to campus where he spends most of his time.   “The restaurants a lot cleaner, I don’t have to pay to park there and there’s a welcoming atmosphere,” he says.\r\n	\r\nOne of the things Sullivan has noticed about the Corridor is the shape the street is in.  “The quality of the road is night and day when you pass 127 going west,” he says.  Along with some roadwork, Sullivan would like to see a little more in the way of entertainment for the college kids in the area. \r\n\r\nOnce a college hotspot in East Lansing, the Dollar now sits vacant on Michigan Avenue just west of campus.  “If someone were to put in a club or place for college kids to go, they’d probably have a lot of success there,” he says.

Not Your Average Gallery\r\n\r\n<STYLE TYPE=\"text/css\"><!--P {text-indent: 30pt;}--></STYLE> As a senior in the College of Arts and Letters at Michigan State University I am ashamed I didn’t know about (SCENE) metrospace before now. (SCENE) metrospace is a local, trendy art gallery that is most often free to the public. And don’t for one minute think this is just your average art gallery. No, THIS gallery has art that pushes the boundaries of comfort and tradition; concerts and dance performances that will leave you wanting more; film nights, gallery talks and even release parties. By now your mouth should be watering. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9aSXZjBNEL8/TLMM3o9wuHI/AAAAAAAAAF8/xfbAE6Mr1A4/s400/othello.jpg\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9aSXZjBNEL8/TLdcjV7z-WI/AAAAAAAAAGU/IaZ6irAAu9g/s400/DSC_0661.JPG\">\r\n\r\n<STYLE TYPE=\"text/css\"><!--P {text-indent: 30pt;}--></STYLE> The man behind the curtain is the one and only (SCENE) metrospace director, Tim Lane. It takes quite a remarkable person to maintain the flourishing livelihood of such a frisky gallery. Luckily I was able to get some insight into the how and why East Lansing gets such a fabulous resident to lead the art community. Growing up Tim was surrounded by artists, poets and musicians, especially on his mother’s side of the family. These influences lead to four successful years at Michigan State resulting in a degree in English education. He roamed around after graduation and in 1993 he returned to East Lansing to complete graduate school and obtain a masters degree in creative writing. From that point to the present the local MSU poet in residence was Diane Wakoski. “She has been an incredibly prolific poet. She became my mentor.” With a role model like that, Tim was destined for success in the arts.\r\n\r\n<STYLE TYPE=\"text/css\"><!--P {text-indent: 30pt;}--></STYLE> Upon his return he became very involved in the Lansing arts community. Tim became close with local artists and gallery owners and began to participate in local shows and exhibits featuring his poetry. He even got the opportunity to organize open mic nights and poetry readings at a local tea house. In 2005 Tim was able to be involved in a show at (SCENE) metrospace showcasing his own work. From then on it was love at first…sight, touch, sound? The gallery was, and still is, so varied and inclusive a visit was like sensory dessert. When he discovered the soon-to-be retirement of the 3rd director of (SCENE) metrospace, Tim knew he was the right man to continue the creative work of the gallery. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.cityofeastlansing.com/DesktopModules/SimpleGallery/ImageHandler.ashx?width=320&height=480&HomeDirectory=%2FPortals%2F0%2FGallery%2FAlbum%2F9&fileName=Tim%20Lane%20-%20(SCENE)%20Metrospace%20Director.jpg&portalid=0&q=1\">\r\n\r\nh3. Not Your Average Father\r\n\r\n<STYLE TYPE=\"text/css\"><!--P {text-indent: 30pt;}--></STYLE> Although the bulk of Tim’s creative energy goes into the gallery, he still has time to be a father to two teenagers and to dabble in his own art. Today in his free time he paints, writes poetry, and recently has become involved with mixed media including photography. He is lucky enough to have a studio space in the Lansing Old Town area that he is able to work from. To Tim, being the director of (SCENE) metrospace is the perfect job because he gets to do what he loves and gets to have a very flexible schedule which he needs for his family. “(SCENE)’s doing an incredible job at what it’s supposed to do.” If he didn’t have such great respect for (SCENE), there is no way he would be able to do his job so well. \r\n\r\n<STYLE TYPE=\"text/css\"><!--P {text-indent: 30pt;}--></STYLE> The Greater Lansing Community and (SCENE) metrospace are like two fitting puzzle pieces. Lansing is a vibrant city that houses a lot of creative people. (SCENE) is an outlet for all of that creative energy. The shows are 90% appropriate for all ages and this gallery doesn’t censor art or thought. To do that would be to defeat the purpose of (SCENE). “The gallery focuses on exhibits that feature traditional modes of art, as well as conceptual, audio, mixed media and installation art. Some of the art is for sale; some of it isnt. The gallery is a destination, and we strive to provide the contemporary art lover with a unique experience.” Now that is my type of gallery. Even the advertising for shows is created by local artists or Tim Lane himself; a real farmer’s market of galleries. \r\n\r\nh3. Hooked Yet?\r\n\r\n<STYLE TYPE=\"text/css\"><!--P {text-indent: 30pt;}--></STYLE> So if you’re thinking that (SCENE) metrospace is just another stuffy art gallery that will showcase blank canvases on the walls and have a cold atmosphere, you are dead wrong. Each show includes work from multiple artists that is provocative in nature and pushes the envelope. The main desire is to get people to think, to really ponder about things. So the next time you are sitting in your room thinking East Lansing is boring, get off of your bum and take a stroll down to (SCENE) metrospace at 110 Charles Street, right next to Georgio’s Pizza, and give director Tim Lane a high five for doing such an awesome job improving the creative life of this wonderful city we call home.

Native Kentuckian turned Michigander, Michelle has chosen to devote her time and efforts to help facilitate change in our city. Michelle is devoted to fighting the apathetic attitudes that plague Lansing. Michelle is apart the Contemporary Art movement in Lansing which aims and wants to reenergize this community. \r\n \r\n<img src=\"http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/290/big/P1040722.JPG\" width=\"485\" height=\"355\"/>\r\n\r\nFor Michelle Word, art is something that has just always been apart of her life. Art has manifested itself in various ways in Michelle’s life, whether it is her appreciation for Folk Art that has such a strong following in her native Kentucky, or the found art from Lansing that she incorporates in her current art productions. No matter the form, there is and always has been an influence of community behind it.  \r\n\r\n *Roots in Small Town Sensibility*	 \r\nComing from a large family in a small town outside Danville Kentucky, she was always surrounded with women family members that spanned generations, who were in various forms, artists. Her grandmother was a woodworker in the twenties, and did well enough to put all eleven of her children through college. Nine of those children were women, which Michelle describes as Emily Post types. These women would have a large effect on Michelle’s life the subsequently on her art. A few of Michelle’s aunts were antique dealers, in their shops Michelle experienced her first introduction to art. This introduction to art was displayed through the collection of objects, Michelle began to see that these objects could be recombined to form something new. Besides the collection of objects, elements of Folk art also filtered into Michelle’s conceptions of art. \r\n\r\n*Folk Art Reformed*\r\n\r\nFolk Art often entails elements of story telling in it’s wears, such as quilting. Michelle feels that this aspect is also a part of what she is made of. The sewing component of quilting that has also influenced Michelle’s work, due to the actions of piecing together fabric, much like you would piece together a collage. “There is a real relationship there” Michelle’s art is still strongly rooted in where she came from, the Folk Arts that Michelle was introduced to from a young age has stayed with her to become a strong influence on her work as a fine artist. \r\nIt seems that many of the aspects of Michelle’s art has carried over from her childhood and family life in Kentucky. Some of these aspects have now followed her Lansing, where she continues to collect from older generations, and incorporates them into her work. \r\n\r\n*Self-Proclaimed and/or Genetic Pack Rat*\r\n\r\nThe self-proclaimed pack rat that Michelle is, collecting has been apart of her since a very young age. Given that she is not the only collector in her family, Michelle knows that her need to obtain objects is in her blood. Michelle obtains these objects in several ways, the most prominent avenue is what Michelle calls Sally shopping. Lansing is one of the best places or Sally Shopping or what some would call thrift shopping, which includes going to garage sales, estate sale and thrift stores. These places are in no short supply in Lansing, which Michelle takes advantage of regularly to find leftover arts and grafts pieces or number of other things to use in her work. Estate sales in particular are places that Michelle frequents, “ I find it fascinating what someone else chooses to save” It might be this interest that drives Michelle to include these possessions in her work. The Estate sale companies have come to know Michelle well enough that when she goes on the second day of the sale (half price day) they sometimes just give her the stuff that they expect no one else to buy, and in the end would be just thrown away. I appreciate the frugality of Michelle and her work, I think there is something great to be said about someone who takes one man’s trash and turns it into another women’s treasure. Not only does she incorporate her past into to her current work but she also, incorporates aspects of Lansing resident’s through the objects that she has collected from them. \r\n\r\n*Lansing Finds it’s Way Into Contemporary Art*\r\n\r\nMichelle’s use of mixed media leaves a lot of options for objects to be included in her paintings and or instillations. The many of the objects that find their way into Michelle’s work comes from Lansing.  Michelle thinks it is possible that the things she finds here in Lansing are different then the things she would somewhere else. She attributes this to the objects possibly being connected to place in some ways. Michelle does not know if these Lansing objects necessarily inform her work, or that they even are in the back of her mind while she is working, but she does understand the idea that these objects find their way into her work only because she lives in Lansing. And that if she lived in another place like the Southwest or Southern states that there would be difference in the objects that have found their way into her work. Michelle’s art is as much about who she is and where she comes from, as much as it is about where she is now. \r\n\r\n*The Path That Pointed to Lansing*	\r\n\r\nIt is clear that art has always been apart of Michelle’s life, regardless of the form in which it takes. The emersion of Arts and Culture probably shaped the path that Michelle took to get to the places and spaces that she resides in now. The path that began in childhood has lead her to a B.A. in Studio Art with an Art History Minor and the on to a M.F.A in painting. “ I don’t ever remember not creating things” Michelle has always taken art in it’s various aspects seriously, but it was not until she was in tenth or eleventh grade that she knew that she was going to peruse a college degree in Fine Art. Due to the family background that she came from, she was well supported in her efforts. The respect for art was strong in her family, as well as the pursuit of knowledge. The pursuit of knowledge is what brought her to the liberal arts colleges that see attended, which included Michigan State University. \r\n\r\n*Once a Spartan, Always a Community Member* \r\n\r\nThe Michigan State is were Michelle now works and Lansing is now where she lives and makes her art. After receiving her M.F.A from M.S.U she stayed on as a teacher. Currently she teaches Foundation level courses for studio art majors, as well as advanced drawing classes. She is still teaching at M.S.U, but her responsibilities span much larger then just the courses that she teaches. Michelle also does administrative work such as grant writing, planning of exhibits for undergraduate, graduate artists, and also sets up guest lecture series. Michelle explains that sometimes making art, is different then planning aspects of art, and that artist do not always see the importance of these activities. Michelle sees these activities as a way for local artists to get involved in their community. Michelle uses several avenues to connect with the Greater Lansing Arts and Culture Community.\r\n\r\n*Administration = Connection To Lansing Arts and Culture Community*\r\n\r\nA large part of the administrative aspects of Michelle’s job deals directly with the Arts community both at M.S.U. but also the surrounding East Lansing and Lansing community such as the greater Lansing Arts or (Scene) Metrospace. Michelle also says that the administrative part of her job gives her the ability in interact with the Greater Lansing Community in different ways then other artists might. For instance the past few years she has helped the Greater Lansing Arts Council review their artists grants, as well as sitting on the board of (Scene) MetroSpace. This gives her the ability to work directly on the administrative side of things, as well as with artist in the community. The administrative work that she does at (Scene) gives her opportunities that other artist may not have. “ I show at (Scene) a lot, I have been able to do instillation pieces there, that I couldn’t just go and do at another gallery. They know me as a part of this community, I can go to the gallery director and say hey can I have a week just to make a piece that is specific this space” This connection that was formed through community interaction gives Michelle the ability to bypass proposals that she would have to do in order to display in another gallery. Michelle attributes this to the small community of artists that reside here in Lansing, getting to know and connecting with them she says, opens up and fosters new opportunities and possibilities.  Galleries and studios like (Scene), help foster not only connections between artists but also with the community.\r\n\r\n*Physical Proximity To The Community*\r\n \r\nOther faculty members like Michelle are working in studios off the M.S.U. campus, near other community members. This proximity starts to create what Michelle says is a physical community, that becomes a place where the local artists can get together and look at each others work, which gives them the ability to connect with one another.  This connection is important for Michelle and her fellow artists because it gives them the ability to receive feed back, which then gives them the ability step outside of their own heads. This community is really important to Michelle and her fellow artists, she says it can be one of those things that keeps people engaged in making, because when an artists fall to far outside of being around artists, it can be really detrimental to their studio process. Being that Michelle works from her home these connections can be very important. \r\n\r\n*Searching For The Balance*\r\n\r\nMichelle expresses that since she has started working from her home she has had learn to balance the creative and administrative sides of her work. She has much less time to create then she once did, which she has remedied by making a schedule to find the balance. This balancing act has changed Michelle’ work. “ It has changed the type of work that I make. I have a really obsessive process that is sort of changing a bit. I can’t have the same kind of attention to detail, because I don’t have the same kind of time to make work.”  Overall Michelle says that she really likes working from her Lansing home, she can just step into her studio for a bit to do a couple of things and then go back other house hold needs. Michelle says her home studio is quite large, but would be larger if she did not fill it with all the things she buys at estate sales. It seems though that nether aspect of Michelle’s work is suffering art or administrative and especially not the community outreach interaction that goes along with it.    \r\n\r\n*Community Outreach Artist Style*\r\n\r\nThe outreach activities of Michelle’s job help her to connect with the community around her that she may not of connected with before.  The activities of outreach Michelle says are important parts of Arts and Culture Community, which many artists miss. Michelle believes that if more artists got involved in the planning and outreach activities that we would be able to see a change, and that the Arts and Culture community would be significantly different as a result. Being that Michelle has been a Lansing resident since 2003, she has seen the change with her own eyes.  The change she believes does not just happen, but there are many factors that play into getting the ball rolling.\r\n\r\n*Belief In a Creative City, Not A Apathetic City* \r\n\r\nComing from a small town, Michelle values the small town sensibility of Lansing. While her friends are moving to large cities like Chicago, Portland or Denver, she has chosen to take root in Lansing. She believes that if we all move to the one city like Portland, then we will only have one progressive exciting city, instead of communities all over the country. Michelle doesn’t know if she will be a Lansing resident forever, but as of now she is a full-fledged citizen of our city. “It takes people choosing to be apart of a community to facilitate change” This is why Michelle says that she has chosen to stay here. Michelle does admit though, that she has partaken in the apathy that plagues this city, like many of us have. I think that they are very few of us that can actually say that they have always believed in Lansing. Michelle hits the Lansing nail on the head, “ so many people come here and their stuck here, their always ready to move onto the next thing” People never want to put down their roots in Lansing. With change comes belief “seeing the amount of change that has happened in the last five years, you can’t not notice that, it is so visible and you can feel it. It is not just something that you can see, I think you can really feel it when you are out and about” Michelle says the day she bought a house in Lansing is the day she decided that she would never talk bad about Lansing again, she became in her own words “officially 100% a member of this community and I am not going to participate in that apathy” Michelle’s house does not only serve as a home studio but also as a root connection to her community. \r\n\r\n*This Community Is REALLY Important*\r\n\r\nThe Greater Lansing Community is really important to Michelle, and when I asked what she would want the community to know about her and her work, she said that she would like the community not necessarily to know about her but about her cause. She did not call it her cause but that is what I am calling it, because I feel that she has so much passion and belief in our city that she wants the change that she feels art fosters. Michelle wants people to know that there are people in Lansing trying to facilitate relationships, which help this city to change. She wants people to know that there are things transpiring in this community, in hopes that it will help people connect with their community in ways that they have not before. “For me it is less about wanting the people to know about me in particular, as it is wanting the community to realize that there are a lot of really exciting things going on… I want people to know that we exist” The kind of change that Michelle is advocating for in possible through the connections that can be fostered between M.S.U. and Lansing.  “The separation between the two is so arbitrary, but a lot of students here might get to Frandor and that is as far as they go”.  Besides all the examples displayed before, Michelle as uses Social Media in attempt to bridge the gap between Lansing and M.S.U., as well as connect with fellow local artists that can further her work, both artistically and communally.\r\n\r\n*Bridging The Gap Through The Avenue Of Social Media*\r\n\r\nMichelle like many others uses social media to connect with the community and other local artists. The Fine Arts Department that Michelle works for uses Face book to get the word out about a number of events and or activities that they or affiliated organizations offer or participate in. Michelle also uses social media to connect with the local art organizations in the community through their group pages. Michelle says that mostly she tries to bridge the gap between M.S.U and the greater Lansing community through the use of social media. Given the rise of virtual community, these social media avenues could become invaluable to community members like Michelle. \r\n\r\n*Positivity*\r\nMichelle employs a number of methods to produce art work, as well as involve her community through art. The positivity that exudes from Michelle is undeniable, people like Michelle give this community new found hope for change. As we can all see the change has begun and is continuing. “ We are in the middle of a economic downturn in the economy but yet, the change is still pushing on” \r\n\r\nBeing a native of the greater Lansing area, I know that we need more people like Michelle who believe in this community, because it seems at times no one will. Even the possible involvement of the Lansing community in Michelle’s art is what makes Michelle’s work important to city. It is not as much what physically goes into Michelle’s works, or how that physicality manifests in a particular work, but it is Michelle’s belief in our community that matters. Michelle is a local artist that is present in our community, who believes like many of us, that change is possible for the city that so many hate but a few love.\r\n	\r\n\r\n	\r\n','2010-11-09 03:02:13','2010-11-09 15:48:58',NULL,'Eastside',NULL,129,'http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/288/big/P1040724.JPG?1288881194',NULL,NULL),(85,'Local Artist and the Lansing Art Scene','Britta Urness is a recent member of the Lansing community.

She describes the Lansing arts scene as pretty cool, if you can find it. Urness explained that it took her a while to figure out some of the more interesting places to go and check out other artists’ work.  Even showing her own artwork was a difficult task, but once you find it, it can be very interesting. She describes places like Metrospace, that bring a different perspective and have a great perspective on eye-catching art. Urness wishes it were easier to find the best places to discover new artists in Lansing and wonders if there is a better way of advertising for more shows and galleries.

So I take objects, or mostly rocks, branches, and bring them to the studio and transform them into new compositions,” Palagyi said.\r\n\r\nOften Palagyi takes inspiration from her community, and how it relates to the surrounding environment. \r\n\r\n“I live in Lansing, fairly close to downtown, the Grand River runs behind there, and my husband and I run on the river, and there are these shells,” Palagyi said. “I gathered a bunch of shells from the river, and I have used those in paintings over and over again.”\r\n\r\nLocal art venues such as Scene Metrospace and Basement 414 also serve as a type of inspiration for Palagyi.\r\n\r\n“I’ve shown artwork [at Scene Metrospace] several times, and the Basement 414 in Lansing,” Palagyi said.\r\n\r\n“[Sometimes] there will be themed shows that will cause me to think about my paintings in a different way.”\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b224/CaronCreighton/palagyi1.jpg\" alt=\"palagyis workspace\" width=\"450\" height=\"350\"></img>\r\n\r\nAlthough she creates her artwork in a studio space she herself described as less-than-desirable, Palagyi still finds ways to appreciate the space and the other artists who work there.\r\n\r\n“There is at least one artist who’s there now that we’ll have critiques of each other’s work and talk about different directions, if something is working or not working,” Palagyi said.\r\n\r\nPalagyi also works part time at Michigan State University’s Museum, sometimes taking inspiration from the natural science collections, as well as certain areas on campus.\r\n\r\nStepanhie Palagyi takes her art extremely seriously, however, it wasn’t until she was pursuing her undergraduate degree at Montana State that Palagyi really began to see this as something she could pursue as a career.\r\n\r\n“I would say one of my professors in particular, in my undergrad, really made me feel like this was something that you can take seriously, and have a career and do something with,” Palagyi said. \r\n“After taking classes with him I started to really consider it as a profession, or a serious endeavor.”\r\n\r\n','2010-11-09 23:31:22','2010-11-12 03:48:47','http://stephaniepalagyi.com/','East Lansing',NULL,149,'http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b224/CaronCreighton/palagyi2.jpg',NULL,NULL),(92,'Poetry and the Creative Class','<strong>Pat Robertson, I Hate You</strong>\r\nby Stephanie M.

Though, that’s not the only thing this working artist does in her day-to-day life. Frith also works at exhibits, consulting workshops and is involved with her community in her spare time.\r\n\r\n<b>The Beginning</b>\r\n\r\nFrith grew up in the farming town of <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=nashville,+mi&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=Nashville,+MI&gl=us&ei=XS7sTIWyNMSYnAeM0uWCAg&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CBMQ8gEwAA\">Nashville, MI</a> where at seven years old she picked up her first camera. At just fourteen years old, she learned the process of printing her photography. After starting out as a photojournalism undergraduate at <a href=\"http://www.lcc.edu/\">LCC</a>, she has traveled to South America, the <a href=\"http://www.arizona.edu/\">University of Arizona</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/\">University of Michigan</a>, to finish up her undergraduate and graduate degrees, until finding her home back at LCC. Working in photography, the return back to Lansing, MI was not to become famous, rather to be active in what she loves to do, Frith remembers.\r\n\r\n<b>Community and the Arts</b>\r\n\r\nWhen Frith isn’t teaching at LCC, she enjoys spending her free time gardening, working with her community, and partaking in being a Lansing social activist. Community is important to Frith because “art is the sole of the community” and by spreading art around the community, it helps to bring people together. Working with <a href=\"http://www.iloveoldtown.org/\">Old Town</a> from the beginning and the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Lansing-MI/Creole-Gallery/115431259573\">Creole Gallery</a> in Lansing, Frith can take on just about anything. Staying active in the community is important to Frith and she does so by keeping up to date with local politics and elections. She uses outlets such as small press and alternative press to get her information; as well as larger networks like NPR and BBC.\r\n\r\n<b>Bringing People Together</b>\r\n\r\nWhile Frith enjoys using social media outlets for friendly communication, she believes “real connection comes when people meet and are in the same place.” Many of the connections she has made over the years comes from that direct communication with people around Lansing to broaden her horizons and expand her photography. \r\n\r\n“Beauty is not just a hanging on the wall,” Frith explains, and it is shown through her photography which you can find at exhibits around Lansing. Frith is now working on a new website with her business partner, Monique Goch, called “Moxy Imagery and Photography” to be released in the coming year.','2010-11-09 23:32:14','2010-11-23 23:30:17',NULL,'Lansing',NULL,144,NULL,NULL,NULL),(100,'Fredy Rodgriguez: Between Thought and Expression','Fredy Rodriguez sees the world in words. Through his poetry, Fredy is able to give a voice to aspects of the human condition often left unheard. Themes such as love, pain, injustice, poverty and human rights act as the skeleton to his poems, which all string together to create pieces that showcase human emotion is all its guises.\r\n\r\nBorn in Honduras, Rodriguez was influenced by authors like Gabriel García Márquez and Rubén Dario from a young age. But it wasn’t until he moved to the States in 2000 with a scholarship to attend college that acted as the impetus to his passion for writing. To Rodriguez, poetry acts as a powerful vehicle to self-expression. “[Poetry] documents very meaningful episodes in your life. It allows us to express and work out certain emotions in a different kind of personal conversation.” Not only that, but writing poetry can also be therapeutic, allowing him to reconnect with his culture and language by writing his poems in Spanish and then translating them to English. This duality of language perfectly encapsulates his immersion into the American lifestyle while paying homage and staying connected to his heritage.\r\n\r\nBecause inspiration can strike at any moment, Rodriguez doesn’t have one, concrete workspace. This allows him to explore what Lansing has to offer and write about what compels him, without being confined by the walls of a workspace. The places in which Rodriguez works the best, however, are local Lansing coffee shops such as Gone Wired Café and Espresso Royale, where the constant buzz of people—whether it be fellow poets, friends, or complete strangers—adds the perfect backdrop to his writing process.\r\n\r\nRodriguez stays connected to the Greater Lansing area through his Facebook page where friends and colleagues about upcoming projects, shows and events. Other ways to find out about the work local poets, including Fredy, are the <A HREF=\"http://www.oldtownarts.org/art.php\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Old Town Poet Society</a>, <A HREF=\"http://rcah.msu.edu/poetry\" TARGET=\"_blank\">RCAHs</a> <A HREF=\"http://www.facebook.com/RCAHMSU\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Center for Poetry</a>, and <A HREF=\"www.scenemetrospace.com\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Scene</a> <A HREF=\"http://www.facebook.com/scenemetrospace\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Metrospace</a>, which act as great resources for people interested in the different poetry readings and events held in the area as well as creating a social media hub for the poetry community to communicate with each other and the public.\r\n\r\nRodriguez is currently working on publishing a collection of poems that chronicles an entire years worth of experiences in Honduras, Philadelphia and Lansing, entitled _Desperate Dawn of the Shortest Night and Other Poems_ as well as helping to organize MSU’s Center for Poetry’s “Festival of Listening,” which is an annual event held through the Residential College in the Arts and Humanities where poets from all over are invited to read their work unhindered by translation, preserved in their native (or adopted) tongue.\r\n\r\nYou can also see some of his work online at <A HREF=\"http://udel.edu/~brownd/msj/\" TARGET=\"_blank\">The Main Street Journal</a> (issues 2 and 4) as well as <A HREF=\"http://lansingonlinenews.com/arts/poemaday-charioscuro-by-rodrigo-bocanegra\" TARGET=\"_blank\">lansingonlinenews.com</a> (under the psedonym Rodrigo Bocanegra).

In Lansing, one such artist is embracing this transition with innovation. \r\n\r\nLewis Michael Smith, Lansing resident and artist, has worked with photography since the early 70’s when he took a college class in photography. Smith said, “Once you develop them, you get hooked.” \r\n\r\nSmith shoots everything from landscapes to models and themed series. Dealing with these projects in the digital realm allows for a new form of art that has changed the way photography captures attention. The manipulation in imagery to convey feelings and incorporate thoughts becomes a whole new element.  “It’s like music, starting with a tune developing lyrics and putting together a song,” Smith elaborates. \r\n\r\nIt wasn’t until about five years ago that Smith began to take his art seriously, turning it into a profession. It started when Smith entered some of his professional pictures in the Jackson Country Fair and won first place, and every thing seemed to spiral upwards from there. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.msu.edu/~bowsersa/wings.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis Michael Smith\" style=\"float: left; padding: 10px;\"></img>\r\n\r\nThe Lansing area drew Smith in with its diversity and the ease of being able to talk to people in the community. He has had the opportunity to find models that can really encompass a persona and have a deep connection with the theme of the art. Smith encourages anyone to help tell a story in a moment, “Anyone that has something to bring to the table needs to be involved.” \r\n\r\nLewis Michael Smith’s Photographic Studio is located at 16991 S.

She brands herself with her Facebook and LinkedIn pages and keeps her fans up-to-date—announcing new pieces and appearances at exhibits—via <a href=\"http://www.k8cosgrove.blogspot.com/\">her blog</a>.

Music has always been important to him, starting mainly in high school doing what many high school students do; play popular music and adapt to the tastes they develop.\r\n\r\nHe draws quite a bit of inspiration from a part of Lansing called <a href=\"http://www.reoartalley.com/\">REO Town</a> and to some extent Old Town that began with creating projects for local youths to participate in which lead to the publication of a book containing the works created by these young people which then led to an exhibition at Michigan State hosted by the College or Arts and Letters.  Through this initial project had evolved into something far greater then he had imagined and created quite a few connections that he had not previously found a way into.  He is also in the midst of more projects in the area as well as potentially doing some collaborative work with the cities of Detroit and Grand Rapids.  These interactions along with his photography, he said, helps to get him out what he refers to as the fragmented and isolated academic community and to create more vibrant connections with people that he said is the first since he has found himself here in Michigan.\r\n\r\nIn so far as to say where he works and creates his pieces he said that about 90% of what he does is done at his home near the Islamic center in East Lansing, which he describes as a non-typical neighborhood for this area.  For his music he works almost exclusively at home other then when he he needs to use a piece of technical equipment at the University.  For photography, even though all of the editing is done in his home, he said that it is one of the best ways to “gets [him] out of [his] ruts and grooves” and “go places and see what happens”.  For him this is an exploration of areas which he never really paid attention to, for example he told the story of one day he spent exploring and rediscovering the coal pile behind the power plant in Lansing which he said he had seen thousands of times but never paid much attention to.\r\n\r\n','2010-11-23 20:05:10','2010-11-23 20:05:10','https://www.msu.edu/~sullivan/','East Lansing',NULL,140,'https://www.msu.edu/~soutaraa/wra415/sullivan2.jpg',NULL,NULL),(108,'Sarah Christiansen: Old Towns Fresh, Modern Photographer','<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ericdornbrook/5202267147/\" title=\"name by Eric.D.D, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4127/5202267147_e2d933122d.jpg\" width=\"274\" height=\"102\" alt=\"name\" /></a>\r\nAlthough Katalyst Gallery is new to the scene in Old Town, it’s owner, Sarah Christiansen, has been around art since her days studying Graphic Design at Saginaw Valley State University.

It was at this point when Sarah decided it was time to follow her heart and do what she loves. Looking to open up her own gallery, it wasn’t hard to decide where that location would be.\r\n	\r\n“Old Town was the place known for art, known for being creative,” stated Sarah. Christiansen used her Graphic Design background to provide the modern art lacking at many galleries in the area. \r\n\r\n <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ericdornbrook/5202869692/\" title=\"IMG_1883 by Eric.D.D, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5283/5202869692_3dfe63c296.jpg\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" alt=\"IMG_1883\" /></a>\r\n\r\n_Sarah usually takes her photos while traveling.

In search of a hobby, in October 2002, he bought a how to paint set and fell in love with it. After a while of relearning the craft the passion for art has become a canvas in his profession as an instructor. \r\n\r\nAs an artist there is always inspiration all around. What Ten Eyek finds most inspirational is the students on Michigan State Universities campus.  The energy, excitement, and the ability to try new things is very inspiring. The influence on the inspirations comes from how the students talk to him about art. It excites him to try and think how other people think, to look at all angels. \r\n\r\nTen Eyek doesn’t use social networking much, but he has a lot of knowledge of gallery owners. He knows how often is too often to show art in Lansing. Never being one to seek someone out, it is fairly important because others may know of other avenues. His wife is a photographer so they both push each other, supporting each other’s work as they both are artists.  \r\n\r\nThough he is not really involved heavily with social networking he uses Facebook to get the message out about showings and locations. Also the upcoming dates as well.. \r\n\r\nTen Eyek works 99% from home in DeWitt. There he works with his wife, based on the work she does he sees the realistic view captured in his wife’s photography and he works off of that. He likes to work outside it is just something about the energy. “The pure of love of something that makes you realize you can do anything you put your mind to,” he said. \r\n\r\nYou can find out about him on his website www.teneyekart.com. If you ever get a chance to go out and see any of his work he is featured in Craig Mitchell’s art gallery in Meridian Mall in Okemos, Michigan. \r\n\r\nHe wants everyone to know, “see in art what you want it to be.” Art should have boundaries but see that anyone can do this. Toby says it best, “Anyone can do this, anyone can pick up a paint brush.” “Everyone is special, try not to judge.”\r\n\r\n','2010-11-23 21:48:18','2010-11-23 21:48:18',NULL,'DeWitt, Lansing, & Okemos',NULL,150,NULL,NULL,NULL),(110,'Dylan Miner - Artist & Storyteller','	Dylan Miner is not just an artist; he’s a storyteller. While many artists rely on the imagery and visual appeal to define their art, Dylan offers a deeper, richer message in order to reach the observer on a level that transcends their eyes: “I feel that as an artist I can communicate in a way that other forms of rhetoric cannot.” While Dylan’s work has been showcased and published in many areas throughout the United States, his connections to Michigan remain strong in his art.\r\n\r\n<h3>Art to Learn From</h3>\r\n\r\n	Growing up in Northern Michigan, Dylan continues to find inspiration in the connection between the state of Michigan and social justice issues, which is a common trend in much of his work. “Much of my work is about radical Michigan and Great Lakes history,” said Dylan, who was gracious enough to give me a copy of a recent poster he produced highlighting the Flint Sit-Down Strike of 1936-37, as seen below. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/316/big/100_2636.JPG?1290552488\" align=\"right\" height=\"320\" width=\"200\">\r\n\r\n	The use of posters and other print items to spread knowledge about social issues meshes with Dylan’s involvement with JustSeeds (<a href=\"http://www.justseeds.org\">www.justseeds.org</a>), a website that specializes in the creation and distribution of artistic posters throughout the Lansing area, especially in the Michigan Avenue region surrounding the Gone Wired Café. Dylan spends a good amount of time traveling throughout the area to meet with members of the JustSeeds cooperative.\r\n\r\n<h3>Objects as Symbols</h3>\r\n\r\n	Perhaps one distinguishing element of Dylan’s artwork is his use of objects. In his most recent work, Dylan showcased the relationship between the sport of baseball and the oppression within Latin American communities (a common theme in his work, connected to his time spent in New Mexico) throughout history. In his September 3-October 8, 2010 exhibition at Cleveland State University, titled \"A Bundle of Twigs (Is Strong)\", he utilized several wooden baseball bats by imprinting images on the wood and neatly lining them throughout the corridors of the exhibit. While the wooden bats symbolize the game of baseball during this time period, Dylan indicated that there is a more conflicted message within the implementation of the bats in the exhibit: the bats represent both baseball and violence (bats were often used in the oppression of Latin Americans during this time). Click <a href=\"http://www.csuohio.edu/artgallery/2010-2011/BundleTwings/\">here</a> to check out the gallery for this exhibition.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://dylanminer.com/images/installation/CSU5.jpg\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://dylanminer.com/images/installation/CSU7.jpg\">\r\n\r\n<h3>Telling a Story</h3>\r\n\r\n	Though Dylan interacts with most of his audience in person rather than online (through face-to-face interaction, art conferences, and exhibitions), he does understand the value of social media, stating that, “I think social media, when used properly, can help link people today in an organic way.” When asked what element about his work was most important for communities to know about his and his work, Dylan replied, “The stories I tell. As an artist, I am creating stories about various situations. Unfortunately, these stories are not the ones we learn in school.” \r\n\r\n	That statement is a very good representation of Dylan Miner, a skilled artist who possesses a strong passion to use his art for the spread of knowledge. His desire to indulge in historical elements of Michigan resonates well with the Michigan Ave. corridor, which has established itself as a threshold for creativity, knowledge and stories. \r\n\r\nFor more information on Dylan or to observe more of his artistic work, visit <a href=\"http://www.dylanminer.com\">dylanminer.com</a>.\r\n\r\n','2010-11-23 22:44:09','2010-11-23 23:05:11','www.dylanminer.com','East Lansing / Michigan State University',NULL,153,'http://dylanminer.com/images/anarquista.jpg',NULL,NULL),(111,'Contributing to a Community','Initiating change within a community is not an easy task. Finding ways to keep that change implemented is even more difficult. Doctor Laura DeLind, an anthropology professor at Michigan State University, puts in her time and services to help better the Eastside of Lansing. Concerned mainly with the food and agriculture industries, DeLind hopes that her project – in addition to producing good food—will promote a sense of place, and social belonging and citizenship within the community. “Food and agriculture programs have meaningful roles to play in bringing a neighborhood together” DeLind says. However, Michigan’s economy has made it very difficult to keep social programs like these funded. DeLind notes that “unless our projects are embedded into the people of the community, they will not be sustainable. Making these projects an integral part of living for the community is the only way to keep them sustainable.” \r\n<a href=\"http://www.lansingurbanfarmproject.blogspot.com/\">The Lansing Urban Farm Project</a> has been a main priority for DeLind, as well as the staff of the <a href=\"http://allenneighborhoodcenter.org/\">the Allen Neighborhood Center</a>. Located in Urbandale, this project is community based and volunteer run and has become a staple of the Eastside community. As the first urban farm in Lansing, this project, this project required a tremendous effort from many devoted individuals to get to the point it is at today. In addition, DeLind works with the Ingham County Land Bank, the Garden Project, the city’s Office of Planning and Neighborhood Development, MSU’s Student Organic Farm and various other projects focused on the Eastside of Lansing. All of this effort requires not just energy, but a lot of passion for the work. DeLind says she gets her passion and inspiration from her co-workers and friends at the Allen Neighborhood Center, “I like the way they think and I like their values” she says.\r\nIt truly does take a community of dedicated individuals to encourage change. Even though DeLind has dedicated her career to bettering the community, she recognizes that it would be impossible without teamwork. \r\n','2010-11-25 18:30:07','2010-11-25 18:30:07',NULL,'Eastside',NULL,141,NULL,NULL,NULL),(112,'Musician with Local Aspirations ','*Local Aspirations*\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMatt Bliton describes his musical aspirations as \"local.\" His gigs often include coffee shops, local festivals, and benefits around Lansing. He picked up the acoustic guitar at age fifteen, inspired by guitar heroes like Neil Young, Bob Dylan, and James Taylor. He performed at bars throughout college, but today his music serves more than the bar crowd. Bliton plays for the community, for the students at the middle school where he keeps his day job, and for his family and friends. He describes his life as a musician as \"cushy,\" noting that hes privileged to be able to play and record music with his sons, perform at venues near Lansing, and share his musical talents with students at the middle school.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/319/big/Matt_Bliton_3.jpg?1291081389\"alt=\"text\"width= 500px\"/> Photo by Corrina Van Hamlin\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen Bliton reflects on his experiences as a musician, anyone can see what delight writing, playing, and performing the music he makes is to him.

His songs have historically been more focused on chord progressions, but in the past few years he has become more comfortable writing lyrics. \"Its about developing a relationship with the medium,\" Bliton says.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n*Making Connections*\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOne of the most special opportunities Bliton has to share his musical talents is with students at the middle school where he works as a counselor. \"It is such an honor,\" Bliton says, \"For some of the students, Im the first live musical performer theyve ever seen.\" While he describes the experience of playing to his students, Bliton says that hes lost for words because it is such a delight. \"The best part is, theyre not shy. Theyre not afraid to be in the front row.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe way Bliton feels when he connects with or evokes an emotional reaction in a listener is special. \"When Im playing one of my original songs, and people are listening carefully, its a cool feeling - so much different then the recognition of familiarity when I play a cover like Neil Youngs Heart of Gold.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHe admits that he was always a little skeptical of the idea that art is a community service, but when people tell him that they like to listen to his songs while they study, or admit that one of his songs gave them goose bumps he feels that he is providing listeners something significant. Bliton says,\"As listeners and as musicians too, we hope for that, we hope for a connection.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n','2010-11-30 00:39:30','2010-11-30 01:47:34',NULL,'Kedzie Street, East Lansing',NULL,136,'http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/297/big/Untitled1.jpg?1289345211',NULL,NULL),(113,'Were all in this together','Barb Whitney has seen art communities all over Michigan.

Right now, she says, they are fractured — at least physically and, even somewhat collaboratively. The future looks like a place where the “World class pieces and collections” of the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum are connected to the Lansing Art Gallery as well as the galleries and boutiques of Old Town and REO Town. \r\n\r\nWhen someone thinks of one, they think of the other. It essentially would be an experience that does not end at MSU or downtown Lansing or Old Town, but instead informs and further defines each community. \r\n\r\nIn that sense, social media could play a significant part in creating discourse among leaders and artists, residents and travelers alike. As Whitney put it, \r\n\r\n“It seems you could open a dialog about whatever project you’re working on and get people to pay attention,” Whitney said.\r\n\r\n“The more people and organizations that become invested the more social networking takes place. If I post and my friend sees it, and she posts it on her page it spider webs out from there.”\r\n\r\nAs an artist, Whitney said she feels social media has helped her spread her work to places where it might not have been seen before. \r\n\r\nEven then, it does not negate the work of galleries such as the one she manages, but instead adds to their appeal — the tangibility of the actual art. \r\n\r\nIn general, she believes the creativity and open-mindedness of artists can bring help social media initiatives.

And yet how many people truly know about the organization and countless workers behind the cross? Although many of Lansing’s citizens know to some degree that there is a City Rescue Mission reaching out the homeless and impoverished among us, fewer know what really goes on and how many lives are being transformed as a result of the mission. I was able to sit down with Executive Director Mark Criss and find out more about both his personal journey with the Rescue Mission, as well as the work that takes place day in and day out on Michigan Avenue and beyond.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/447/big/IMG_0983.JPG?1321927019\" width=\"500px\"\r\nheight=\"300\"> A view of the Rescue Mission along Michigan Avenue\r\n\r\nAlthough at first glance Lansing City Rescue Mission may seem like any other organization trying to better the lives of the homeless, it differs at its core. Many shelters exist in order to meet the basic needs of the homeless – food, shelter, clothing, etc. The Rescue Mission, however, goes deeper than just meeting physical needs. _“We aren’t ashamed of our purpose,”_ states Criss. They offer shelter and provide food in order to be able to reach out to the needy with the gospel of Jesus Christ. They don’t want to just see needs met, but rather lives transformed. Many times everyone has given up on the homeless, and they have even given up on themselves. _\"It’s only through God’s grace that they are changed. That’s the beauty of rescue mission work – they may come for a meal or a bed, but find eternal life,”_ Criss says. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/446/big/IMG_0982.JPG?1321926970\" width=\"450px\"\r\nheight=\"250\"> Executive Director Mark Criss in his office\r\n\r\n*Marks Journey to the Mission*\r\n\r\nMark Criss hasn’t always been involved in Rescue Mission work. In fact, fifteen years ago he didn’t even know what the Rescue Mission was. He worked for a large technological organization in Lansing before becoming Executive Director of the mission. Criss remembers traveling along Michigan Avenue in 1996 and noticing a big cross on the side of one of the buildings. He was intrigued by it and asked his Pastor what it was there for. The very next week he contacted the director and immediately got involved serving meals every Thursday. Pretty soon he was bringing his whole office along to serve meals because the need for volunteers was so great. Criss was involved at this level for several years and then served on the Board of Directors for several years after that. When it came to his attention that there was a need for a night director, he felt that it was time for him to become more involved and fill the position. It was during this time that he really began to see the transformation of lives up close. He saw people change from existing in hopelessness to living in hope. He realized that life is more important than salaries and job benefits. For Criss, the benefits of working in the Rescue Mission are lives that are changed and transformed by God. \r\n\r\nAfter working for several years as the night director, Criss began to feel strongly that he wanted to step up and work full time for the ministry. Interestingly, the previous director who had been with the Rescue Mission for 16 years was at that time looking for a replacement. After working together for a year, Mark Criss became the new executive director of the City Rescue Mission, and has been in his current position for seven years. Criss’ main responsibilities include administrative work such as dealing with the budget, communications, and a variety of other tasks. He also teaches one to three times a week in the addiction Recovery Program, as well as preaching before meals served at the Michigan Avenue center. Throughout his daily work routine, he has a lot of interaction with guests (as they refer to the people who come to the shelter’s various programs). \r\n\r\n*History of the Rescue Mission*\r\n\r\nThe Lansing City Rescue Mission was founded in 1911 by Thomas and Emily Dalton, and celebrated its 100th year anniversary this year. Thomas had been an alcoholic when he found faith in Christ. After he was saved, a passion grew in him to reach out and help other men who were also leading lives of addiction. His wife was sensitive to the needs of the wives and children of alcoholics, as that had been her life for many years. She saw that many of the children were being neglected as a result of the alcoholism. While Thomas focused primarily on the men, Emily’s focus was with the women and children. In the early stages of the Rescue Mission, the work consisted primarily of services with preaching, and gifts of bread and other food staples, shoes, clothing, etc. given to the needy after services. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/439/big/IMG_0865.JPG?1321926453\" width=\"300px\"\r\nheight=\"500\"> \r\nThomas and Emily Dalton\r\n\r\nIn 1930 a soup kitchen was opened, and although they received pressure from the Mayor to close their doors because it cast the city in a bad light, they refused and continued to reach out to those on the streets. In 1949 the first building was purchased, 611 Michigan Avenue, and the mission became incorporated as the Lansing City Rescue Mission, complete with a Board of Directors headed by the Dalton’s son in law. In 1957 the first overnight men’s shelter was established, which allowed homeless men a warm bed for the night. In the late 1980s the Rescue Mission began expanding to include a place for women and children as well. By the early 1990s they began purchasing homes until they had four in which to house the women and children. In the mid-2000s, the Rescue Mission had the opportunity to purchase and renovate the old Maplewood school on South Cedar, which between 2010 and 2011 became the new Women and Children’s center as well as the location of the administration offices.\r\n\r\n*Services Provided*\r\n\r\nLansing City Rescue Mission currently has 46 beds for mothers and children and 70 beds for single women, all located at the Maplewood Center. There are over 100 beds for men at the Michigan Avenue center, which are nearly full to capacity. The Michigan Avenue center is home to the men’s shelter, Rescue Mission kitchen, food pantry, personal needs closet, and public dining room. In the month of October alone, the mission housed 178 men, 189 women and children, and served a total of 10,712 meals. One of the biggest challenges that face the rescue mission today is funding. The mission is a non-profit, privately funded organization, receiving all of their funds from the donations of churches, organizations and individuals. Less than 10% of yearly costs are administrative, meaning over 90% are used to cover costs of programs and services, as well as public communication. As printed in a recent newsletter:\r\n\r\np=. _Every day, hundreds of men, women, and children come through the doors of the City Rescue Mission. They are looking for food and shelter and receive so much more: comfort, Truth, compassion, and hope. For 100 years, the City Rescue Mission of Lansing has existed to meet physical and spiritual needs in Michigan’s capital area. The Mission is established on the principle of faith and receives no government funds. Our own needs are met by the generosity and compassion of those who care about our community: neighbors helping neighbors._\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/440/big/IMG_0864.JPG?1321926600\" width=\"450px\"\r\nheight=\"250\"> \r\nLife education classroom\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/442/big/IMG_0867.JPG?1321926716\" width=\"450px\"\r\nheight=\"250\">\r\nCafeteria at the Womens Shelter\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/449/big/IMG_0978.JPG?1321927262\" width=\"450px\"\r\nheight=\"250\">\r\nCommunity style dorm for single women\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/443/big/IMG_0976.JPG?1321926757\" width=\"450px\"\r\nheight=\"250\">\r\nDorm room for mothers and children\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/444/big/IMG_0977.JPG?1321926804\" width=\"450px\"\r\nheight=\"250\">\r\nBed and crib for mothers and children\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rescue Mission not only offers services for basic needs, but also rehabilitation for addicts. Although not everyone who is homeless is addicted to drugs and alcohol, it is an underlying cause of chronic homelessness. Because between 25 and 50 percent of chronically homeless males struggle with addiction, workers at the Rescue Mission had to find a more “permanent” solution and get to the root of the addiction instead of just treating the symptoms. This treatment program is different from other programs in the fact that it doesn’t treat addiction as a disease, but as a sin issue that God has the solution to. It’s a 12 month program in which participants attend one to two bible studies a day as well as various other classes; have chores and other job training responsibilities, and attend biblical based counseling sessions. The Rescue Mission requires program participants to join and serve in a church as a requirement to graduation. Right now there is only a treatment program for the men, with an average of 10 to 12 men in the program each year. The Mission sees a great need for a similar program for women, and is currently developing one that will hopefully begin in early 2012. \r\n\r\n*How to Get Involved*\r\n\r\nNot only are thousands of needy people reached through the work of the rescue mission, but those around the community who want to volunteer and reach out to the homeless now have a safe way to do so. There are many ways that citizens around Lansing can volunteer their time and resources such as: serving meals, sorting clothes in the clothing distribution center, childcare, hosting a food drive, supporting the Mission through Community Rewards at Meijer and Kroger, donating money, etc. The mission is also always in need of personal care item donations and this is another great way to help out.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/441/big/IMG_0866.JPG?1321926645\" width=\"450px\"\r\nheight=\"250\">\r\nA childs thank you to workers and volunteers\r\n\r\nThere are many other agencies and organizations around the Lansing area that partner with the Rescue Mission in order to provide other services that aren’t offered there. This includes: CACS (Capital Area Community Services), Community Mental Health, Open Door Ministries, Haven House, and many others. Together they are able to serve a variety of needs that arise among the communities of homeless and low-income around Lansing.\r\n\r\n*Marks Week Homeless*\r\n\r\nMark Criss recently underwent a week of living homeless in order to try to increase public awareness of homelessness around Mid-Michigan, as well as educate people about the work of the Rescue Mission, more specifically in how it pertains to women and children. He slept in the shelter, looked for work during the days, donated plasma in order to earn enough money to buy a CATA bus pass, etc. One thing that he noticed during this week was how many homeless women and children there truly are. Many people are under the impression that most homeless are the stereotypical 40 year old male, but that’s not the case.  It also reinforced in his mind what the Mission is there for, to reach out to individuals who are lost and hurting. He was able to interact one on one with people, hear their stories, understand where they come from, listen to their hopes and dreams, etc. According to Criss, as an administrator it can be easy to lose sight of individual guests. If he leaves his office at the Maplewood center and people at the Michigan Avenue center don’t recognize him, he feels he isn’t living up to his job of reaching out to those he has been led to reach. _\"It [the week homeless] enabled me to have even more compassion than I thought I could have for people,”_ says Criss.\r\n\r\n*Homelessness is Not Stereotypical*\r\n\r\nThrough his work in the Rescue Mission, Mark Criss has come to learn that the homeless community is made up of individuals who each have their own personal struggles. Each one comes with their own story. Each one is homeless for his/her own reason. _“There is no stereotype that says this is why someone is homeless. I found out very quickly that they are ordinary people with ordinary dreams and hopes, but they are unique. This tells me that there is no single solution that will solve homelessness.”_ As a result, the Mission does its best to meet the basic human needs that everyone shares, but it can become complicated when addressing issues of emotional scars that are unique to every individual. \r\n\r\n*Future Plans*\r\n\r\nWhat are the future plans of the Lansing City Rescue Mission? It can be summed up in one word. Expansion. There are three specific areas in which the Mission is looking to expand over the next few years. The first is in the work dormitories for the men. There is a separate dormitory room for men who are actively trying to get work, but they are forced to turn men away because they are already at capacity and can’t house any more. The second is a larger Transient dorm for the men’s shelter. This is where men come who sign up for a bed for the night and then leave in the morning. The space is tight with beds very close together. They would like to expand this room in order to provide a few more beds as well as give some privacy and free space to the guests. The third area of expansion will be in the kitchen of the Michigan Avenue center. All of the cooking for both shelters is done in that kitchen, and there’s not much room to work. With the size of the kitchen they have now, they won’t be able to provide any more meals than they are serving at this time. The goal is to expand the kitchen into the building where the administration offices were before moving to the Maplewood center. \r\n\r\nIf you would like more information about the Lansing City Rescue Mission, want to make a donation, or are interested in volunteering, you can visit the website at <a href=\"http://www.lcrm.org/\">Lansing City Rescue Mission</a>\r\n\r\nTo find out more about whats going on at the Rescue mission check out the facebook page at \r\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/City-Rescue-Mission-of-Lansing/26800363393/\">City of Lansing Rescue Mission Facebook</a>\r\n\r\nYou can also visit the Rescue Missions partnering organizations at:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.cacs-inc.org/\">Capital Area Community Services</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ceicmh.org/\">Community Mental Health</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.havenhouseel.org//\">Haven House</a>\r\n','2011-11-22 02:14:31','2011-11-23 23:17:54',NULL,'Stadium District',NULL,160,NULL,NULL,NULL),(116,'All Aboard!

Cindy Jubeck, current owner and daughter of the original owner Peter, speaks about how she remembered the Michigan Avenue Corridor in the 1970’s, “There wasn’t anything downtown. Besides hotels you could rent by the hour and the government buildings, there just wasn’t much that pulled people into the city.”\r\n<img src=\"http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/451/big/DSC09239.JPG?1321929276\" width=\"400px\"\r\nheight=\"300\">\r\nThe restored and rehabilitated train station holds local history, international treasures and some pretty good eats. Cindy hosts a local artist’s work in the front entrance of the restaurant whom she said is a friend of hers. She also pointed out a sculpted cherub finial on the grand staircase that used to belong to R.E. Olds’ music room inside of his mansion located in Lansing. R.E.Olds is a local icon and means a lot to the city’s heritage and history. Another gem of the newly refurbished interior is the large chandeliers throwing light along the timbers of the exposed ceiling. Three of the crystal chandeliers are from a opera house in London, England from the early 1900s when this station was in its heyday.\r\n<img src=\"http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/452/big/DSC09244.JPG?1321929311\" width=\"400px\"\r\nheight=\"300\">\r\nThe history of the building itself dates back to its opening in 1903, then called “the Union Depot” and saw a lot of men off to various wars over the years. The station also hosted many politicians and similar figures as they traveled across the country on campaigns or the like. Pictures from newspapers show speeches being given off the back of a caboose to the people of Lansing surrounding the departing train. Some elements in the station even call back to when the circus would come to town. \r\n<img src=\"http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/453/big/DSC09248.JPG?1321929339\" width=\"400px\"\r\nheight=\"300\">\r\nThe restaurant upon opening immediately began to change the feeling of the road to downtown Michigan Avenue Corridor, “I believe  that the work my father put into this restaurant really began the trend of people coming into the downtown area for entertainment and a night out.”\r\nShe was right. Clara’s Lansing Station predates any of the now more popular venues that operate presently. To name a few, the Cooley Law School Stadium, the Lansing Convention center, and the Lansing City market. Clara’s presence on Michigan Avenue has brought local restaurant goes and some from further reaches of the state into the city for their great food and small slice of Michigan’s unique and nostalgic history. Whether you dine in the main room, adorned with nearly a hundred antique pieces of art and period styled stained glass, or you choose to dine in the reclaimed 1910 Pullman dining car, any time spent admiring the décor(and even learning a bit of history) is time well spent.\r\n\r\nPlease visit <a href=\"http://claras.com/LNindex.shtml\">Claras Lansing Station</a>s website to learn more! \r\n\r\n\r\n','2011-11-22 02:40:24','2011-11-22 02:45:32',NULL,'Downtown',NULL,159,NULL,NULL,NULL),(118,'Bancroft Designs- A Small Town in a Big City','<img src=\"http://ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/454/big/P1170465.JPG?1321941121\" width=\"300px\" height=\"250\">\r\n\r\nWalking into Bancroft Designs, I was greeted with the soft jingle of the overhead bell, and a friendly hello from an employee. Looking around, I was instantly overwhelmed by the amazing smell of fresh flowers and the intense array of bright colors. The shop had an enchanting way about it, making me feel like I had been there 100 times, even though it was my first visit. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/455/big/P1170463.JPG?1321942004\" width=\"200px\" height=\"300\">\r\n\r\n\r\nTalking to the owner, Ruth Leyrer, this feeling increased. Ruth has owned Bancroft Flowers RL Designs for the past 9 years, and is the 3rd owner of the Michigan Avenue location. Ruth has been a florist since 1969, and when asked how she got to be a florist, she laughed, saying it kind of “just happened.” The most important thing Ruth said, is to “find what you’re passionate about,” and talking with her, it was evident she does indeed have passion for her job. Bancroft Flowers works to provide more services than simply providing flowers; they put together gift baskets, sell candles, works with Sparrow and St. Lawrence’s gift shops, and of course, provides flowers for weddings, parties, and special occasions. Her business is diverse, and that is her number one requirement. The more services her shop provides the more customers Bancroft Designs can serve. \r\n	The charming atmosphere of this shop is not solely because of its customer service but because of the outward dedication Ruth has for her family, her business and her community. Looking around the shop, it was clean, organized, and homey. Although she was dealing with personal family matters, Ruth was in the shop, making sure everything was getting done, and her employees had what they needed. The respect she has for her employees was obvious, and it clearly went the other way as well, as one employee told her, “I’ll be in at 8. If you can’t make it, just leave me the things I need,” understanding Ruth may need to be away from the shop. Her love for the Lansing area, specifically the East Side and Michigan Avenue, was overwhelmingly evident the entire time I was talking with her. Personally, she has been a part of countless community organizations, always working to improve the area. \r\n<img src=\"http://ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/456/big/P1170460.JPG?1321942177\" width=\"200px\" height=\"350\">\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy does Ruth have so much love for her community? She’s been here her entire life. The house she lived in growing up is close to her shop, she had her first job at a competing florist, (who, when I asked where she worked, laughed and said she couldn’t tell me a competitor’s name), and met her husband in junior high. “He found me, “ she said, laughing. “I didn’t like him at first, but he was a persistent little thing.” Her children were raised in the EastSide, and now work in East Side themselves. \r\nThe enchanting charm in Bancroft Design is one in a million. When you walk in, you are really in a small town among a big city. The love for the flowers, the customers, and the community shine through like a beacon among all the negative publicity surrounding Michigan Avenue. \r\n\r\nPlease visit Bancroft Flowers RL Design at <a href=\"http://www.bancroftflowersrl.com/\">The Lansing \r\nUrban Farm Project</a','2011-11-22 06:04:53','2011-11-22 06:13:32',NULL,'Eastside',NULL,163,NULL,NULL,NULL),(119,'Emils Italian Restaurant - Defining Lansings East Side for over 90 years.','The Eastside neighborhood can be characterized by a wide range of different individuals, establishments, and locations, but perhaps the most notable, defining business is Emils Italian Restaurant at 2012 E. Michigan Avenue, located between Clemens and Fairview Ave. on the south side of the street. The story behind this magnificent local eatery is one of true, unmatched hospitality, ingrained Lansing history, and fantastic meal choices.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/460/big/emils_front_entrance.JPG?1321984867\" width=\"90%\" height=\"90%\"></img>\r\n\r\nAs Lansings oldest restaurant, Emils was established in 1921 as a fruit stand which was owned and operated by Emil DeMarco as his first venture in a new country. An Italian immigrant, Emil soon established a notable reputation in Lansings east side, and even the city as a whole; he continued to expand his business with the inclusion of an ice cream parlor and by obtaining a coveted beer license, one of the first in Michigans history, which he used to establish his restaurant as a neighborhood saloon as well.\r\n\r\nThroughout the years, Emil combined his intuitive nature to help others with his driven mind for hospitality business to create a definitive, unmatched reputation among the Lansing community. With authentic Italian dishes and a laid back, inviting setting, Emils was a hit and word spread among prominent individuals, tourists, and local families.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/459/big/IMG_1240.JPG?1321984349\" width=\"90%\" height=\"90%\"></img>\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of meeting with Paul, Emils grandson, who operates the restaurant along with his family today. When asked about the character of the restaurant and how it relates to the overall image of the Eastside and the City of Lansing, he mentioned that its all about the historical significance: \" Being the oldest restaurant in Lansing, Emils naturally draws in customers with its deep history and reputation. Just recently, a couple drove all the way down from Mt. Clemens based on what theyve heard about the restaurant and they loved the food and the atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the history and quality speak for itself, perhaps one of the largest elements of Emils is the physical appearance of the restaurant itself, from the colorful curb appeal to the elegant styling of the interior. Much like many other Eastside locales, Emils has worked to create a definitive look while holding onto the same building and preserving the same physical character. For Emils, classic photography, elegant lighting fixtures and accent pieces/decor, vibrant exterior color and architecture give the restaurant a unique persona while mixing well with the spirit of the Eastsides creative class and cultural communities.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/458/big/emils_mural.JPG?1321983365\" align=\"center\" width=\"90%\" height=\"90%\"></img>\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, through listening to Paul and soaking in the atmosphere of the Eastside neighborhoods, one of the most prevalent elements of the change within this geographic area (as well as the traditional success of Emils) is the emphasis on family and togetherness. As Paul carefully puts it, \"If it wasnt for the families, we wouldnt be in business. Its a tradition that goes back to the very beginning and will always have a role in the success of any neighborhood establishment.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it comes down to it, the Michigan Avenue and Lansings Eastside hold a very abundant lineup of businesses, communities, and  intellectual draws that area very similar to the worlds most creative cities and communities, and Emils adds a deep dimension to the phenomenon that is Eastside neighborhood. To Paul, \"Much like the Capitol Building and some of the most prominent historical places in Lansing, Emils easily fits in the conversation. People who truly want to relate to and absorb the spirit and character of Lansing come to eat at Emils.\" Nonetheless, further exploration into the relationship between Emils and its many facets should explore the ideal of a dynamic society with a focus on the arts, technology, and social capital, which makes the notable Italian restaurant an ideal candidate.\r\n\r\nTo try out the many fantastic dishes that Emils has to offer, there are plenty of delicious, affordable specials available throughout the week, including All-You-Can-Eat Pasta on Tuesdays for $5.95, All-You-Can-Eat Ribs for $8.95, and $8.95 Baked Spaghetti on Thursdays, with all meals including plenty of soups, salads, and sides included in the price.

Easily overlooked by those commuting from East Lansing to downtown Lansing and vice versa, Macs is well-known among the \"underground\" music scene, drawing in small numbers of deeply-appreciative locals and travelers for one-of-a-kind concerts and gatherings. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/467/big/IMG_1386.JPG?1324348392\" width=\"90%\" height=\"90%\"></img>\r\n\r\nI had the chance to speak with the shift manager and lead bartender, a tall, quick-witted man named Craig, who has worked at the bar for over five years. Since the bar was conveniently empty throughout this particular night, it was also a great night to take a careful look around the bar to check out the thousands of scattered band stickers, hand-written notes, and promotional posters. All of these subtle artifacts add a very deep element into the bars connection to Lansings live music scene and Eastside character.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/468/big/IMG_1377.JPG?1324348881\" width=\"90%\" height=\"90%\"></img>\r\n\r\nAs Craig quipped, \"Macs started out as a mainly rock and punk bar back in the day, but nowadays theres a whole mess of different genres that play here, especially with electronic music.\" Many of the acts that play throughout weekly venues, including their dubstep-, trance-, and techno-driven Neon Tuesday, work to reach a number of devout bar patrons and music-lovers. Their business is more about reaching a large number of smaller demographics as opposed to focusing on one set of customers.\r\n\r\nBeing that Macs is actually named after the Michigan Agricultural College (MSUs former moniker), the bar makes a deep effort to draw in the student community by appealing to many of the younger locals, whereas other bars in the area seem to cater to a larger range of clients. \"We definitely get large groups of college students throughout the week,\" says Craig, \"but honestly the groups are really diverse. Its typically for a younger, twenty-something crowd, though, which goes with the music.\"\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/469/big/IMG_1384.JPG?1324349186\" width=\"90%\" height=\"90%\"></img>\r\n\r\nOn top of that, one of Macs most important ventures is working in local musical acts and performers. When asked about the relationship between Macs and local musicians, Craig said, \"We are always open to bringing in local acts. When it comes down to it, if it werent for local bands, we wouldnt nearly see as much business and support as we do.\" From Battle of the Bands shows to local-based venues, Macs prides itself on bringing in a close-knit, indie music community that gives the bar a distinctiveness thats hard to get anywhere else in the city.\r\n \r\nIn Craigs words, Macs \"is a place for those who want to hang out with some great, unfiltered music. Anyone who wants to grab a PBR, maybe a shot of some Jameson, is always welcome here.\" For more information on shows and Macs bar itself, visit their official website at <a href=\"http://macsbar.com/\">macsbar.com</a>.\r\n\r\n','2011-12-17 01:37:14','2011-12-20 02:49:52',NULL,'Eastside',NULL,153,NULL,NULL,NULL),(123,'The Green Door - A Bar that Lives and Breathes Eastside Character','Growing up on North Fairview Ave. as a kid, I always had the opportunity to roam around and check out the area, particularly in some of the parking lots and driveways throughout the blocks surrounding Michigan Ave. I remember seeing signs for The Green Door and wondering to myself, \"Whats it like in there?\" I was especially drawn to the constant hum of muffled music coming from the bar on select nights.

The Green Door shares much of its interior design from that of your typical watering hole, complete with rustic wooden trim, a simple raised stage, brew posters, and KENO advertising. Yet, there are several very intriguing elements of the bars appearance that incorporate the distinctiveness of Eastside commerce, mainly at their main entrance facing the Michigan Ave.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/464/big/IMG_1323.JPG?1324344918\" width=\"90%\" height=\"90%\"></img>\r\n\r\nThe groove appeal of the bars iconic cat symbol, complete with sunglasses, fedora, and acoustic guitar is a careful representation of the vibe youll get from music here at The Green Door. As the bartenders and shift managers unanimously put it: you wont find club dancing, raging, and bass-driven hip-hop here...its all about a mellow, laid back sound, which creates a nice ambiance throughout the bar-goers.  As one bartender put it, \"Most of the people who come in here are from the area; theyre regulars. For them, its an opportunity to spend time with friends without traveling all over the city to do it. The vibe here has always been laid back and chill.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding the music, most acts feature a smooth rock and jazz fashion spread across a typical week at The Green Door. For instance, every Monday the crowd-friendly blues/folk stylings of <a href=\"http://www.steppininit.com\">Steppin On It</a> play to loyal fans, from local residents to traveling attendees from throughout the Midwest. Other acts include <a href=\"http://www.thesmokingjackets.com/\">The Smoking Jackets</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/suburbaneuphoria\">Suburban Euphoria</a>, and EL-favorite <a href=\"http://www.starfarmband.com/\">Starfarm</a>.(Alert: music plays on some linked websites)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/465/big/IMG_1314.JPG?1324347694\" width=\"90%\" height=\"90%\"></img>\r\n\r\nTheir website also does a great job of advertising their shows much like youd see in a copy of City Pulse or Lansings former entertainment info-source, NOISE. A calendar grid page displays show times, and headlining acts, complete with links to band websites that have info and music samples, sometimes even downloadable albums. Speaking from experience, venues like The Green Door that showcase big acts with great music to a small, refined fan base and bar clientele creates a very unique, enjoyable experience that you just dont get from the likes of large concerts or night clubs.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ourmichiganave.org/system/photos/466/big/IMG_1317.JPG?1324347922\" width=\"90%\" height=\"90%\"></img>\r\n\r\nAll in all, Im hoping to nail down a chance to speak with the owner at some point so I can learn about the bars beginnings, their involvement with local Lansing-bred acts, and a well-refined perspective of the Eastside music scene. From what I can gather so far, however, is that Eastside music venues are very heavily influenced by the members of the community (who are the main customer base) and a near-rejection of contemporary, snobbish forms; meaning, the bar is characterized by great music, affordable  drinks, and cool, interesting individuals. Coupled with the segment of East Lansing and other surrounding areas in the Capital Area, this can create a sophisticated, creative community that works together many cultures and experiences, further enriching the Eastside environment. \r\n\r\nUltimately, the best way to see this for yourself is to work your way down to The Green Door and see it for yourself.
